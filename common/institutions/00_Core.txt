#VU - Updated by San Felipe for 1.36.2.*
#
# remember to add graphics for relevant ones when you add to this
#
# if a modifier is scaled, its multiplied with development in the province.


# any_friendly_coast_border_province is a special scope made for institution spread.
# It checks for adjacent provinces or provinces one seazone away.
# Friendly is defined as at positive relations or owned by the same country that owns the province.

#Victorum Universalis Addon Note -
#Please note that if adding any new tech groups, they will require entries in each institution's embracement speed header, I'd recommend searching 'VU South American Tech Spreads' and adding new entries to the bottom of the list.
#In general, changes are to speed up spread where there have been many new provinces, slow spread in areas that are getting way too much tech in the new system, and use force potential more often, to clean things up for countries who can never obtain the various region specific bonuses
#Note VU adds many new provinces to overhauled areas, but also lowers the average development of those provinces (Tags have the same total dev spread over more provinces). As institutions spread from province to province scaled to dev, this means without changes, institution spread will be markedly slower
#than in vanilla. This is the justification for speeding up spreads.

#One of the largest and most drastic changes here is halving the AI factor for embracement, making the AI wait until the price is lower (i.e. institution has spread to more provinces) before embracing. The logic follows.
#Vanilla system (at least with VU dev, not sure about vanilla) has countries embracing new institutions immediately once one, two, or rarely three provinces embrace the institution, even for large-ish countries like Spain, England, and Austria. This will hopefully encourage countries to wait until it has spread
#a bit more. Ideally, I'd like to see countries embrace when between 1/4 and 1/2 of their provinces already accept the institution, not every single province, and not just their one richest city, but a moderate portion of the nation.

#Tech group list for reference below. As/if I add new groups I'll try to add them here as well.

Asia will still be missing the printing press until Europeans spread it, but all other institutions can be obtained organically, albeit with slightly more effort than in Europe and perhaps a
