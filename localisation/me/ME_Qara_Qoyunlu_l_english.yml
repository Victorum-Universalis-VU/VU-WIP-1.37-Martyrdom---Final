 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.11.d: "Qara Qoyunlu in 1444 is rather decentralized and is ruled by many powerful tribal and de jure leaders. Nowhere is that more pronounced than in Mesopotamia,  where the rule is held by Jahan Shah's brother, Ispend Mirza. But his rule too, will not last long, for his age is really showing and his death may be imminent. With Jahan Shah's centralization ambitions, the weak son of Ispend, Fulad, will be of no match for him. All that Jahan Shah needs is the pivotal moment where he can ride into Baghdad, unopposed. But we will not stand for that! Whatever the future may be, we will prevail!" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.11.a: "[From.Monarch.GetName] will meet his demise in the waters of Euphrates!" 
  
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.12.t: "Ispend's Death" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.12.d: "Ispend Mirza of [BAG.GetName] has finally succumbed to the icy grips of death. The local Nobility is already prepared to swear fealty to his young heir, Fulad Mirza, and his regent, Alvand. We must move quick and take immediate action if those scoundrels are to be defeated without much opposition. The sooner, the better!" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.12.a: "Time to retake what's ours." 
  
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.13.t: "The Fate of Armenia" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.13.d: "Armenia by now has seen decades of rule by the Qara Qoyunlu. Never a single policy, the Qara Qoyunlu would commit anything from regular raids to plunder, while also giving privileges to local Catholicoi. A unified policy must be decided for the future!" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.13.a: "They are at our mercy! Raze the land!" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.13.b: "Settle our tribes into the northern plains."

 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.14.d: "With thw defeat of Alvand Mirza, the regent of the Baghdadi Sheikhdom to the south, the Qara Qoyunlu is now whole again. The nobles of Mesopotamia were 'convinced' to swear fealty and all lands have by now submitted. Fulad has been dethroned, while the treasonous Alvand has fled the country to rival Aq Qoyunlu." 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.14.a: "The flock is whole again." 
  
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.15.t: "Fall of Muhammad ibn Falah's Sheikhdom" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.15.d: "We have finally managed to deal the striking blow to the zealous armies of Muhammad ibn Falah, a false idol naming himself as the Mahdi who would free the world of evil. Blasphemous! Though shedding the blood of fellow Shi'ite Muslims is most unfortunate, this apostasy could not be tolerated, and Ibn Falah's past campaigns against us really showed that. He shall agitate no more!" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.15.a: "By the Shi'ite and the not, history shall only remember him for his blasphemy."

 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.17.t: "Qara Qoyunlu Meddles in Ardalan" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.17.d: "Our actions were enough. The attempts at having Ardalan nobles switch allegiances have been a resounding success. We grow ever more powerful." 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.17.a: "Let us hope for more successes like this!"

 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.19.t: "Matters of Religious Adherence"  
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.19.d: "The exact religious beliefs of Qara Qoyunlu cannot be exactly pinpointed to a single flavor of Islam. It is believed the tribes near Tabriz and in rule sympathised the Shi'ites, but in practice many were also Sunni muslims and religion wasn't as important as in other muslim states."
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.19.a: "We shall acknowledge our Shi'a sympathy." 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.19.b: "We are so close to the light, yet so far."

 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.21.t: "Rise of Jahan Shah" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.21.d: "Jahan Shah is the most celebrated of all Qara Qoyunlu Sultans. Under his military command and prowess, the tribal confederation would take over much of Western Iran, claiming the mantle of Persian Monarchs. His military skill seemed unparalleled. But his age was not devoid of other inspiring leaders, as he would suffer losses from Uzun Hasan, a leader that would defeat him and second him as ruler of Persia."

 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.23.t: "Fate of the Aq Qoyunlu Tribes" 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.23.d: "The Aq Qoyunlu confederation is much like ours. Also a Turkic Oghuz state claiming descent from tribes of old, we have much more in common than not. While this might instill a sense of confraternity, it has lead to nothing but bitter rivalry. And today, those tribes lie defeated and at our mercy. We either let them integrate into our realm or let them become hosts for our more loyal tribes.
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.23.a: "Let them join our federation." 
 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.23.b: "Settle in the tribes at home."

 ME_Qara_Qoyunlu_Events.25.d: "The Pontic Emperors have long professed a policy of strategic marriage with the Aq and Qara Qoyunlu monarchs. Having continued and accepted this policy on our side today we sit as the Seniors in that relationship. Much more powerful, we may now request them to finally become our vassals."
