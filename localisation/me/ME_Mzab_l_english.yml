 MZB_form_rustamids_desc: "As far back as the early 700s, the Ibadi movement had planted its roots within the communities of northern Africa. Despite persecution, ridicule, and endless violence the faithful eventually found peace within the deserts of Algeria. It is here where they began their great kingdom, the Rustamid Dynasty. A cosmopolitan paradise of learning and trade, the glorious kingdom drew in visitors from across the Christian and Muslim worlds. The once golden city of Tiaret, the Lioness, was the center of it all, a true testament to the heights of this magnificent realm. As the sands of time blew across the desert, they began to shroud this fabulous legacy. However, our success as of late has revived the memories of this once great realm! Having dusted off the tomes of old, many in our realm proclaim our Imam the true successor to the Rustamid legacy. Let us embrace this destiny and push the Ibadi faith, and the Rustamid Kingdom, to new heights. Inshallah!"

 RST_small_community: "Tiny Communities"
 RST_small_community_desc: "Dotted across the vast deserts of Algeria, our nation consists of numerous, highly independent, communities. Many would view this as a weakness but, as Ibadis, we know see the value in small communities of the faithful. So long as each one is led by its most pious man; well versed in fiqh, and skilled in the art of warfare, these communities will be able to prosper."
 RST_convert_the_heretics: "Convert the Defiant"
 RST_convert_the_heretics_desc: "All people who profess their belief in the oneness of God may be tolerated to some degree. Those who further believe in the prophetic nature of Muhammad are members of the ummah, or the wider Islamic community who should garner our respect. However, it is our duty as the only true Muslims to guide the ahl al-khilaf, the unbelievers, toward the true path. Our communities should be encouraged to follow notions of walaya, affiliation, with Ibadis and bara’a, disassociation, with unbelievers. In this way we can ensure that the heretical masses are slowly turned towards the light."
 RST_persian_origins: "Persian Origins"
 RST_persian_origins_desc: "The first Imam of the Rustamid Dynasty, Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam, was born in the hallowed mountains of mighty Persia. Under his leadership, the Persian language was adopted by the elites of our society and is still used in small pockets to this day. Since time immemorial, Persia has proven itself to be a critical artery of Islamic scholership and culture. By embracing our distant Persian ties, we may experience a new golden age!"
 RST_learned_men: "An Ocean of Scholars"
 RST_learned_men_desc: "As Persian influence seeps into the fabric of our society, we can begin to join a long list of countries that use the Persian language as a lingua franca when discussing science and philosophy. And , because of our high tolerence of heretical Muslims, scholars of the Sharia from all over this Islamic world may find shelter from persecution within our borders. As learned men flood into our desert home, the bring with them a river of knowledge."

 RST_major_stop_along_trade_routes_desc: "The Sahara desert is as vast as it is desolate. Security is almost as rare as water and food when traveling the deserts vast trade routes. However, as our oasis cities rise above the rolling dunes to meet the eyes of weary travelers they are sure to breathe a sigh of relief. Those souls who dare make the trek to our lands do carry one thing in great store, gold. We must utilize our central position in the desert to lighten the loads of our guests and collect a piece of their fabulous luxaries and vast hordes of treasure."

 RST_berber_tribes: "Berber Adherence"
 RST_berber_tribes_desc: "Despite our best efforts, it is important to realize that not all members of our state will adhere to the one true interpretation of Islam. Crucially, many of the petty Berber tribes which roam our lands may not always see eye to eye with us spiritually. Ultimately, however, this doesn’t matter so long as they are loyal to our Imam, as such we must ensure their loyalty through all manner of statecraft. We will teach these wild dogs to heel at the command of our mighty Imam, whatever it takes."
