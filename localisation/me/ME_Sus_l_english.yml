 ME_Sus_Events.1.t: "An Imposter Among Us"
 ME_Sus_Events.1.d: "One of our heralds reports that a man has been spotted pretending to be [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself in one of the major cities of the realm. Unfortunately, the local garrison has chosen to believe the man instead of apprehending him, which gave the imitator enough time to be showered in gifts and to cause chaos in the city. The imposter is allegedly on his way to other cities of the realm to use his deceptive tactics for personal gain.\n\nOr so it would seem, if not for the fact that no other reports of such activity have been reported, and the likeliness of such occurence is close to none. It is suspected that the herald has simply gone insane. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could of course choose to believe him and to try and find which rival of ours decided to send a spy to our cities."

 ME_Sus_Events.2.t: "Calling An Emergency Meeting" 
 ME_Sus_Events.2.d: "As the news of the impostor incident broke, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was quick to call an Emergency Meeting in the court. The reason, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] cites, is that there is a conspiracy against him. Then the accusations started and the room discussion turned into who can shout the loudest. So chaotic it was, that even I don't know who was where and what tasks they had done. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] told everyone to shut up at once and then said:" 
 ME_Sus_Events.2.a: "We must stick together from now on."

 ME_Sus_Events.3.a: "Our soldiers shall help raise monuments!." 
 ME_Sus_Events.3.b: "The Impostor must be found." 
 ME_Sus_Events.3.c: "Send them to do tasks in the barracks." 
  
 ME_Sus_Events.4.t: "The Impostor is Found" 
 ME_Sus_Events.4.d: "While it may be hard to believe, after capturing this one peculiar local Sheikh, who looked oddly similar to the old master, we can be finally conclude that we have ejected the imposter. The imitator of course tried to claim innocence citing an alibi, 'I was in the city of Sousse conducting diplomacy!' to no avail. After this he tried to accuse one of his courtiers wearing a white turban when he uttered 'White sus' at which moment he had his mouth shut by one of our generals. The imposter is surely found... or is he?" 
 ME_Sus_Events.4.a: "Yes, now decapitate him!" 
 ME_Sus_Events.4.b: "Very suspicious... is [Root.Monarch.GetName]! Indeed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was the imposter all along!"

 ME_Sus_Events.6.t: "Adopting New Techniques" 
 ME_Sus_Events.6.d: "As our spies gain proficiency in their art, their techniques are getting more and more mystical. And that is good, because the imposter could be in this very room. It could be you, it could be me, it could even be-" 
 ME_Sus_Events.6.a: "Haha! They are terribly effective." 
 ME_Sus_Events.6.b: "What? It was obvious!" 
  
 ME_Sus_Events.7.t: "Choice of Claim Fabrication" 
 ME_Sus_Events.7.d: "Our spies are incredibly effective, but their motives remain mysterious. As part of our wider campaign to fabricate lies in order to oust the imposter, they have given us a choice of five provinces to pick from." 
 ME_Sus_Events.7.a: "Let us send the spies to [Sus_Target_1.GetName]." 
 ME_Sus_Events.7.b: "Our diplomats are familiar with [Sus_Target_2.GetName]."
