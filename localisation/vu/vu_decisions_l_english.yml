Gaelic traditions are observed, Irish is the language we hear spoken most often, and our closest allies and friends are the Gaels, not some distant English overlord. We should make this official!"

 recognise_marcharid_of_brittany_title:0 "Recognize young Marc'harid of Brittany as heir"
 recognise_marcharid_of_brittany_desc:0 "Historically, women were able to inherit the duchy of Brittany, and our regnal histories proudly feature the names Janed, Alis, Bertha, and Hawiz, but per the Treaty of Guérande, which ended the War of the Breton Succession, we observe primarily Salic inheritance laws, forbidding women to inherit unless there is no surviving male in the entire line. Unfortunately, Fransez's infant son died in 1440 and his simple brother Pêr is also childless. The Montfort branch of the house of de Dreux is facing extinction, and some feel it may be wise after all to recognise Fransez's eldest daughter, Marc'harid, as heir to the duchy. She is a capable young woman, and her grandfather is the King of Scotland, which may facilitate good relations with them. Unfortunately, France would certainly view this as a violation of the treaty and would be very upset with us, and some factions inside the duchy may even view this as a violation of the law."

 mughal_government_turkish_g_assimilated:0 "Ottoman Bombards"
 mughal_government_turkish_g_assimilated_desc:0 "Super-sized bombards had been used through Western Europe since the 15th century but specifically the Great Turkish Bombard, cast in bronze in 1464 by Munir Ali, proved to be much more capable than any other, being able of firing stone balls up to 0.63 m diameter. Learning such designs and patterns will greatly improve our cannons."
 mughal_government_miao_g_assimilated:0 "Agricultural Expertise"
 mughal_government_miao_g_assimilated_desc:0 "The Miao people have a long and proud history of agriculture. This tradition and expertise could be easily turned to our benefit."
 mughal_government_brythonic_assimilated:0 "Proudly Independent"
 mughal_government_brythonic_assimilated_desc:0 "The Brythonic people represent the last remnants of an ancient culture that formerly covered an immense swath of land across Europe. While much of their richer lands have since been taken by Germanic tribes and Romans, the remaining Britons have been hammered into a resilient and strongly indepedent people prepared to face all comers and defend their last bastions. We can make use of this proud resolve."

 mughal_government_unified_celtic_group_assimilated_desc:0 "The Celtic people represent the last remnants of an ancient culture that formerly covered an immense swath of land across Europe.

We can make use of this proud resolve."
 mughal_government_illyrian_assimilated:0 "Brilliant Leadership"
 mughal_government_illyrian_assimilated_desc:0 "Despite their small numbers, the Albanian people have produced some of the most renowned commanders throughout history. Brilliant military minds such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt or Skanderbeg have achieved notorious feats many times in difficult situations. Having such people to lead our armies will grant us a tactical advantage over our adversaries even when losing footing. "
 mughal_government_aquitanian_assimilated:0 "Guerrilla Tactics"
 mughal_government_aquitanian_assimilated_desc:0 "The Basque people have usually been the last of Iberia to be conquered, if conquered at all, by the many empires and kingdoms that have come to the peninsula. If we learn of such knowledge of irregular terrain and use of guerrilla tactics, we will make sure our enemies feel what we felt when conquering the Basque people."
 mughal_government_dacian_assimilated:0 "Draculesti Legacy"
 mughal_government_dacian_assimilated_desc:0 "\"... Turkish messengers came (to Vlad) to pay respects, but refused to take off their turbans, according to their ancient custom, whereupon he strengthened their custom by nailing their turbans to their heads with three spikes, so that they could not take them off.\"\n— Antonio Bonfini.\n\nThis is just one of the examples of the well spread legacy of Vlad the Impaler. Let our enemies know that we shall not hesitate to apply the same fate to those who dare oppose our rule."
 mughal_government_egyptian_assimilated:0 "Ethnoreligious People"
 mughal_government_egyptian_assimilated_desc:0 "The Copts, Christian indigenous people to Northeast Africa, were once the majority group in Egypt. After the Arab conquest their fate changed quickly, but to their surprise under the Mamluk sultanate they found a more lenient attitude towards them. Copts then lived in relative peace and stability for some centuries. This situation improved more when Muhammad Ali came to rule Egypt. He repealed special taxes on copts, permitted their military service, and introduced many other integration policies."
 mughal_government_saharan_group_assimilated:0 "A Simple Life"
 mughal_government_saharan_group_assimilated_desc:0 "Fur people are a relatively small group consisting of mostly semi-nomadic cattle herd families and small agricultural towns. Being a fairly simple society governed by village elders and known for their Muslim piety, we can learn from them how to better administer our lands at a local level."
 mughal_government_berber_group_assimilated:0 "The Barbary Pirates"
 mughal_government_berber_group_assimilated_desc:0 "The Maghrebi cover the northern coast of Africa. They have a long experience of pirating the rich trade brought in by the Italian states. We should enlist them into our navy by making them Privateers."
