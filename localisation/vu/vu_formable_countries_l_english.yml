 #Belgium
 BEL_ideas:0 "Belgian Ideas"
 BEL_ideas_start:0 "Belgian Traditions"
 BEL_ideas_bonus:0 "Belgian Ambition"
 bel_first:0 "Rapid Industrialization"
 bel_first_desc:0 "Belgium is a small nation compared to its neighbours, in both land and population. However, the advent of the Industrial Revolution has granted us the ability to outclass and outproduce our rivals. Thus, we must take great efforts to Industrialise our nation — no matter the cost."
 bel_second:0 "Unity Makes Strength"
 bel_second_desc:0 "For centuries, the lands of Flanders and Wallonia have been divided between local and foreign rulers. No more! Our nation shall triumph over those who seek to divide and conquer our people; not by diplomacy or sword, but by every man standing under a united banner! One arrow alone can be easily broken, but if you try to break a bunch, it becomes folly to persist."
 bel_third:0 "Fortified Borders"
 bel_third_desc:0 "The foreign powers seek to rule over and oppress us; they eye our lands greedily and without rest. Though we have many feudal fortifications in our lands, we must reinforce, renovate, and rebuild them to keep up with ever-advancing siege weaponry."
 bel_fourth:0 "Flemish Ports"
 bel_fourth_desc:0 "The Flemish cities of Antwerp, Bruges, and Gent have benefited greatly from the expansion of canals and waterways in the region. These port cities now have the capacity to handle ever-increasing commerce, not to mention home bases for the Belgian navy."
 bel_fifth:0 "Defensive Doctrine"
 bel_fifth_desc:0 "Not that we like to admit it, Belgium is not a very strong nation in terms of its military or defensive position, to add to that, nations neighbouring us happen to have some of the world's strongest armies, waiting to crush us at any opportunity they get. As such, our generals have adopted a defensive strategy that focuses on whittling down enemy forces and fighting battles only when victory is assured."
 bel_sixth:0 "Staunch Religiousness"
 bel_sixth_desc:0 "Ever since the Belgae were brought into the Christian fold many centuries ago, the small bishopric villages which followed the missionaries’ arrival have grown into sprawling urban centres. Even now, the Belgian people have steadfastly maintained the piety which reforged their heathen ancestors."
 bel_seventh:0 "Belgian Colonial Empire"
 bel_seventh_desc:0 "We have been largely incapable of expanding our holdings in Europe due to the powers that be, but new opportunities lie outside the Old World. The Americas, Africa, India, and so many more lands of opportunity await Belgium’s coming! The petty kings and tribes which inhabit these areas are weak and uncivilised, and so we must show them the light. Needless to say, conquering these lands will also bring great wealth and prestige to the fatherland. "

 TNA_ideas:0 "Gaelic Ideas"
 TNA_ideas_start:0 "Gaelic Traditions"
 TNA_ideas_bonus:0 "Gaelic Ambition"
 tirnangael_bards:0 "Celebrated Bards"
 tirnangael_bards_desc:0 "More so than in any other culture, our bards, poets, musicians, and storytellers are celebrated, respected, and admired. Whether travelling from place to place, being employed by a local king, or perfecting their craft in isolation, our artists are without peer and highly sought after. Throughout the land, lineages are recorded, battles are imortalized, and history is brought to life through word and chord."
 tirnangael_gall_oglaigh:0 "Gall Óglaigh"
 tirnangael_gall_oglaigh_desc:0 "The Vikings had significant influence on all of Western Europe, but perhaps nowhere more so than in Gaelic lands, where they settled in great numbers and founded many of the greatest cities. Though they quickly adopted Gaelic culture, language, and religion, the proud martial tradition of these Gaelicised Norse prompted the native Gaels to begin an enduring tradition of hiring these strangers as mercenaries. Known as gall óglaigh, or foreign warriors, these units would go on to become some of the most sought after mercenaries in Europe."
 tirnangael_explorers_legacy:0 "Legacy of Exploration"
 tirnangael_explorers_legacy_desc:0 "Hundreds of years before the Vikings constructed their first longships, and nearly a thousand years before the great navies of Europe began to sail westward, Gaels were sailing and exploring the North Sea, establishing remote settlements and monastic hermitages. To compete in this new age of exploration, we must restore this proud heritage and set sail for undicovered shores."
 tirnangael_brehon_law:0 "Brehon Law"
 tirnangael_brehon_law_desc:0 "Brehon law is a comprehensive system of secular civil laws administered by professional jurists, called Brehons. Dating back to antiquity in Ireland, the legal system is one of the oldest surviving in Europe, and provides great stability. Though largely supplanted by English and Norman law with the conquest of Ireland, it was revived and experienced a renaissance as English influence over Ireland waned."
 tirnangael_gaelic_renown:0 "Gaelic Renown"
 tirnangael_gaelic_renown_desc:0 "Under the yoke of English rule, the Gaels were relegated to the status of provincial rustics, but once, Gaelic courtiers were renowned throughout Europe as the finest musicians and the most enlightened scholars. From Iberia to Scandinavia, a king was often not considered a true king unless he employed a Gaelic musician and classical scholar. Now free from the bonds of our former English masters, we are free to reclaim this international prestige."
 tirnangael_monastic_heritage:0 "Gaelic Monasticism"
 tirnangael_monastic_heritage_desc:0 "From the earliest exposure to Christianity, the Gaels have enthusiastically and competently spread their faith. From the evangelization of the Picts in Scotland and the Saxons in England, to the rise of Gaelic monasticism in central Europe, the Gaels have maintained a strong ecclesiastical tradition of benign missionaries and adaptable monasticism. While the rest of the British Isles embraced the ideals of the Reformation, the lands of the Gaels remained a bastion of Catholicism and strongly resisted the secularization of church power."
 tirnangael_beacon_of_civ:0 "Beacon of Civilization"
 tirnangael_beacon_of_civ_desc:0 "The Gaels were the first in Europe outside of the Greeks and Romans to adopt the written word for their language, and the only ones to maintain Latin and Greek scholarship when the rest of Europe fell into its dark ages. For centuries the Gaels have been a civilizing and stabilizing force, and now is the time to formalize this by issuing a mandate: Let the Gael be the saviour of idealism in modern intellectual and social life, the regenerator and rejuvenator of the literature of the world, and the instructor of nations!"
