We must look into the trials we failed long ago! In a time past, after the death of Mircea the Great we have allowed unholy forces to slip into our domains. The offspring of our inaction was the rise of the Ottomans and Islam... Yet we did not banish it, instead studying their vile language and religion for our own power and wealth! And the monsters at our door... the unholy infidels who abduct our young for their jannisary corps ? Did we raise our swords against them? Or did we lay our burden on others? The so-called Hajduks...

The battle started after Mehmed, who already had tense relations with Vlad, discovered his alliance with Hungary's king Matthias Corvinus and ordered his forces to ambush him. Vlad foiled the attack and invaded Bulgaria. In response, Mehmed raised a great army with the objective to conquer Wallachia and annex it to his empire. The two leaders fought a series of skirmishes, the most notable one being the conflict where Vlad attacked the Turkish camp in the night in an attempt to kill Mehmed. The assassination attempt failed and Mehmed marched to the Wallachian capital of Targoviste, where he found a few men with cannons. After leaving the capital, Mehmed discovered 23,844 impaled Turks whom Vlad had killed during his invasion of Bulgaria. The number is mentioned by Vlad himself in a letter to Matthias Corvinus. The sultan and his troops then sailed to Braila and burned it to the ground before retreating to Adrianople.

Upon his death, the rule of Naples was ceded to this illegitimate son, Ferdinand, while his brother John II of Aragon incorporated Sicily into the Crown of Aragon. This sparked a series of events such as Pope Calixtus III laying claims over all of Naples as a papal fief (Though he died before he could push these claims), as well as causing great unrest among the Neapolitan nobility. Eventually, when the Italian Wars erupted some decades down the line, the French kings claimed rightful succession to Naples itself and attempted its conquest. This ultimately failed, and Naples reunited under the Crown of Aragon 10 years later. And so, the Two Sicilies would remain ruled by Aragonese, and later Spanish, kings for centuries."

 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTDESC5:0 "As the Enlightenment spread across Europe, several important advancements in science were made by natural philosophers. One of these advancements concerned the complex science of bees and their biology, a topic that had not previously been researched. Some notable pioneers were Jan Swammerdam & René Ferchault de Réamur, who used microscopes to dissect bees to understand internal bee biology. They observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but it was not until François Huber had his advisor conduct careful experiments that they understood the mating process of bees. They found that queens were inseminated through a number of successive matings with male drones, which occurred high in the air, distant from their hive. They were also the first to describe bees' reproductive organs. Huber is today regarded as the father of modern bee-science for his discoveries and research while simultaneously breaking new ground in the formative years of modern biology."

 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTNAME6:0 "Buzzkill Bee-Gone"
 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTDESC6:0 "Beekeeping in Medieval and Renaissance Europe was a complex science that no regular peasant really understood. Beekeeping was therefore mostly left to the monks in abbeys, where the precious honey and beeswax was produced. This was not the only reason for its generally limited production, but in order to obtain said produce, beehives had to be destroyed, thus ruining any potential reuse of the bee colony. It also disallowed any potential selective breeding. This gradually changed during the 18th and 19th centuries, where successive inventions revolutionized beekeeping. Among these were Thomas Wildman's adjustments to beehive assembly. He fixed parallel arrays of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive. The bees would fix their combs onto these, which allowed for easy removal of beecombs without destroying the hive itself. These movable comb hives were later perfected by Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth, who made use of the fact that there was a specific clearance between the wax combs which bees left unblocked by wax, something Huber had previously discovered. Langstroth carefully designed a series of woooden frames in a rectangular hive box which were easily removed by beekeepers for emptying or inspection. Langstroth's invention ultimately lead to the commercial mass production of honey in the western world."

One important factor in this resistance was the support and ecclesiastical training of Gaelic priests by continental Catholic allies who feared the ramifications of a unified Protestant British Isles.\n\nWe were thus not surprised to learn that Catholic rivals of ours on the continent have sent priests to [Root.GetName] in the hopes of returning the population to the Catholic faith. What do we do?"
 VULegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA4:0 "Is the effort to turn the Gaels from Catholicism an endless struggle?! Let them be damned."

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTNAME1:0 "Selection of the Tanist"
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC1:0 "The time has come to select a new Tanist from the available Righdamhna, or Kingly Material. All Dearbhfhine, the male decendants of previous kings up to four generations back, are to vote in the selection of a new Tanist so that in the event of the King's death the Tanist will immediately accend to the position, securing the succession and maintaining the uninterrupted leadership of the Kingdom."         #Was going for a historical basis, but it seems to history-book-ish, so rewriting it, but leaving the old one here   -   Tanistry is the traditional inheritance law of Ireland and most of Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between distant cousins.

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC3:0 "A new heir is now is line to the throne of [Root.GetName], but to the consternation of all, this heir is a young woman! The role of the king is to act as steward to the kingdom and, as part of the inauguration, ritually marries the female personification of the kingdom, imbuing her and by extension the land with his fertility. As a woman cannot fulfill this role, women are traditionally not eligible to ascend to the throne. The prospect of a female ruler is thus enveloping the entire kingdom in a dread panic that upon the ascension of [Root.Heir.GetName], the kingdom will begin to wither and die. Doomsayers proclaim that first the crops, then the livestock, and finally the people will shrivel up and die as the land becomes barren and empty. The royal advisors suggest that a small sum be set aside for the girl's inheritance and that she be disinherited from royal succession."

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC5:0 "In a most unusual and unexpected turn of events, a headstrong and capable young woman has garnered support from some of the Dearbhfhine, and is being considered by many as Righdamhna, and thus eligible for the throne, despite the fact that typically her anatomy would preclude her consideration. Her opponents warn against a woman in the position, as the king is ritually married to the kingdom and his fertility is meant to ensure the success of harvests and livestocks. Her supporters, however, dismiss this as superstition and cite ancient sources and laws asserting a woman's right of inheritance. Shall we encourage the girl's ambitions, or instead select a less controversial candidate?"

Despite outward appearances, however, many in the kingdom are fearful for the future, and doubtful of our continued prosperity. The royal court is simply waiting for the young queen to make a mistake, and word has reached us that small riots are appearing in all reaches of the kingdom as the superstitious fear that their beloved kingdom will become as barren without a symbolic husband.

 VULegacyScandinavianFlavour.1.d:0 "Christopher of the Wittelsbachs rose to the throne of Denmark and the Kalmar Union as a result of the deposition of Eric of Pomerania. Christopher however was merely meant to be a puppet under the Danish nobles and, while he did succeed in maintaining some personal control, the nobility in all three kingdoms ended up acquiring several privileges and policy-making powers that the monarchs had gained from since the Viking ages. The Swedish nobility in particular did not like the king, as evidenced by them nicknaming him the \"Bark King\". \n\nIn 1448, Christopher suddenly died at the age of 32, leaving a power vaccuum that resulted in the Lord High Constable of Sweden, Riksmarsk Karl Knutsson Bonde, being elected king in Sweden, and Christian of Oldenburg being elected King in Denmark, thus sparking a power struggle in the Kalmar Union that would last until 1457, when Christian of Oldenburg would finally be elected the King of Sweden."

Their attempts would succeed at this, eventually crowning Karl Knutsson in the Nidaros Cathedral as king of Norway in November 1449. However, the Swedish aristocracy, mainly the Swedish Church and the noble families of Oxenstierna and Vasa, were very reluctant in backing a Swedish war attempt against Denmark, and so, barely a year later, Karl Knutsson stepped down from the Norwegian throne in favour of Christian von Oldenburg. Later, the Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna and the nobleman Erik Axelsson Tott rebelled againt Karl Knutsson, exiling him to Danzig and elected Christian as the King of Sweden."

 #PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTDESC1:0 "In the duchy of Bavaria-Munich in 1487, Duke Albert IV decreed with the subordinates of the realm the Reinheitsgebot - Purity Law - of Bavarian beer. The law stated that beer produced in Bavaria may only ever contain water, barley and hops. Any diversion from this recipe would invalidate its claim to the name and would lead to its confiscation. The law also standardized the price of beer with a maximum price of a Mass, the Bavarian Liter, at one Pfennig in the winter and two Pfennig in the summer. Innkeepers were however allowed to add an additional half Pfennig per Mass to the sell price, but only if they bought a sufficient amount of 120 Mass from the producer. This law was later then expanded by William IV to include all of Bavaria upon its reunification in 1516. While the law was not the first among beer laws, it was the most famous and would be upheld throughout the history of the Duchy, up until the German Unification in 1871, upon which its application to all of Germany was one of the conditions of said treaty."

If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top-and-bottom fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."

 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC1:0 "Italy, long claimed by the emperor to be part of the Holy Roman Empire, has gradually slipped more and more from the Empire's control. Though occasionally emperors have been able to exercise some influence over the succession and laws in Northern Italy and there are many circles which pledge loyalty to the Empire, this politicking has become, more than anything else, a way to avoid the temporal power of the Pope, and a long string of coalitions and alliances designed to resist imperial influence have arisen, starting with the Lombard League in 1167.  Though the Empire's de-facto control over Italy was tenuous at points, it wasn't until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that imperial power was formally broken and all claims over Italy retracted by the emperor as a concession of the treaty to end the Thirty Years' War."
