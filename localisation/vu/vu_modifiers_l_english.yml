 desc_tribes_of_galway_modifier: "The endeavours of the fourteen merchant families known as the 'Tribes of Galway' bolsters our trade in the region."
 vu_amber_coast: "Amber Coast"
 desc_vu_amber_coast: "The Sambian Peninsula, occasionally called the 'Amber Coast', is the world's primary source of Amber. Mentioned specifically as early as the year 98 by the Roman historian Tacitus,  'Baltic Amber', as it is known, is so particularly abundant in the area that it washes up on the shoreline all on its own. The semi-precious stone is so abundant that despite being collected since distant antiquity, production continued to increase to the point that by the 18th century, it is believe that 95% of all finshed amber produced worldwide originated from this region."
 vu_super_cows: "Friesian Cattle"
 desc_vu_super_cows: "The people of the small grassy islands of northwestern Europe were long known for their pastoral expertise, raising large and productive white dairy cattle since antiquity. Starting around the 13th century, Frisians began elevating this expertise to a whole new level, using selective breeding and millennia of experience to produce the most productive breed of cattle in the world. The result was a typically black and white piebald animal which proved extremely productive, producing a large share of Europe's beef, milk, & cheese."
 vu_brauhaus_der_hansa: "Brewery of the Hansa"
 desc_vu_brauhaus_der_hansa: "The northern coast of Germany came to be know for its beer production, and none more so than Hamburg. Fondly called the 'Hansa's Brewery', the city's brewers were some of the first to use hops, rather than fruit, in the brewing process, and the resulting drink was so popular that it earned the city its nickname. From humble beginning in the 1200s with a few small operations, the city would grow to contain 500 breweries by the middle of the 16th century, supplying much of northern Europe with the finest beer."
 vu_kornhaus_der_hansa: "Granary of the North"
 desc_vu_kornhaus_der_hansa: "Grain is not particularly abundant around the Baltic Sea. Temperatures are generally too cold and the ground too sandy or rocky to sustain more than modest crops of rye in many places, so any fertile soil producing reliably large yields of grain becomes particularly important. The countryside around Danzig is unusually fertile, and its position near the mouth of the Vistula positions it ideal to import grain from further upstream, as well. This combination slowly tranformed Danzig into a major grain port in the late Middle Ages, and eventually it came to be known as 'der Kornhaus der Hansa' (the granary of the Hanseatic League). A large share of Northern Europe's staple grain was either grown here, or at least passed through."

 desc_vu_wines_of_bordeaux: "Winemaking was first introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, but it wasn't until the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1089 that wine production began in earnest. Following the marriage, the Aquitaine region suddenly found itself within the sprawling Angevin Empire, which had a strong taste for quality wine but little other land suitable for intensive viticulture. As a result, the industry was heavily developed and by the mid 1100s Bordeaux was already exporting vast quantities of wine, most commonly a rosé known as 'claret', to northwestern Europe."
 vu_basque_whaling: "Basque Whaling"
 desc_vu_basque_whaling: "The Basque were the first in the world to hunt whales commercially, and the most successful by far until the 18th century. The burgeoning industry was centered primaily along the Basque coast, especially around San Sebastián, which was first granted whaling rights in 1150. By the 15th century there were about 50 'land factories' all along the Atlantic coast, where Basque sailors rented land to flense and butcher their catch."

 desc_vu_queen_of_the_hansa: "Lübeck, occasionally known as the 'the Queen of the Hansa', rose from humble beginnings to become the de facto capital of the Hanseatic Lague, and primary trading hub for all of northern Europe, by the middle of the 14th century."
