 #NEW TERRAIN
 tundra_terrain:0 "Tundra"
 tundra_terrain_desc:0 "Cold regions with scarse vegetation and animal life. Where it's too cold for trees to grow but not cold enough for ice sheet to form. Tundra suffers from severe winters and short, chill summer. It's dominated by shrubs and grass which makes it somewhat easy to traverse. Terrain can vary from flat to hilly but it's generally swampy."
 cold_mountains:0 "Extreme Mountains"
 cold_mountains_desc:0 "Cold mountains, covered in snow for entire year or most of the year. Very high elevation with nearly no vegetation. Those mountains can vary between average and extremely high elevation but their common feature are very low temperatures and little to no plant life. Those mountains, while extremely good for defense, will not be a good place to live in."
 desert_ranges:0 "Desert Ranges"
 desert_ranges_desc:0 "Hills, highlands and peaks located in deserted climate. This terrain combines downsides of both desert and mountain terrain type. Extreme temperatures, uneven terrain and scarse animal & plant life. This terrain is hostile to any permanent settlements."
 dry_highlands:0 "Dry Highlands"
 dry_highlands_desc:0 "Drylands located on elevated and uneven terrain. Hard, infertile soil, lack of lush vegetation, and hot envirorment filled with hills and rocks are not perfect conditions but definetely better than desert."
 swamp:0 "Swamps"
 swamp_desc:0 "A swamp is a forested wetland considered to be transition zones because both land and water play a role in creating this environment. Swamps also vary in size and are located all around the world."
 tropical_highlands_terrain:0 "Tropical Highlands"
 tropical_highlands_terrain_desc:0 "Tropical highlands are areas covered with jungle forests that also have high elevation and very steep or uneven terrain, making it very hard terrain to traverse. Tropical Highlands combine jungle and hill features making this terrain very tough to develop and build on."
 salt_flats:0 "Salt Flats"
 salt_flats_desc:0 "Extreme type of desert. This terrain represents flat, desolate fields of thick salt crust. Fields of salt are bottom floor of periodic lake or remnants of long-evaporated body of water. Extreme envirorment creates almost perfectly flat surface that is devoid of any plant life and animals. Excellent source of salt but very hard place to inhabit."
 mediterranean_grasslands:0 "Mediterranean Grasslands"
 mediterranean_grasslands_desc:0 "Unique type of landscape typical for mediterranean climate. Sunny, dry summers and mild wet winters cause the land to be filled with evergreen bushes and trees of hard leaves. Land can vary in elevation but is rather open, with many small dumps and rocks scattered around the terrain. Somewhat more pleasant than drylands. Easy to live on."
 dry_river:0 "Desert River Valley"
 dry_river_desc:0 "River cutting through deserted or dry lands. Offers safe heaven for various plants and animals. While great for communication, narrow strip of lush vegetation around river quickly transitions into hostile desert offering very small arable terrain. Soil is harsh and sandy but it's better than loose sand. Many civilizations built irrigation systems around river to maximize useful area."
 alluvial_plains:0 "Alluvial Plains"
 alluvial_plains_desc:0 "Fields of fertile and arable land created by vast mineral deposits of meandering river. Throughout time river's floods and changing flow left the terrain with thick layer of material perfect for cultivation. While this terrain is perfect for farming, unpredictable floodings and patches wet terrain are not ideal for dense urban areas."
 fertile_highlands:0 "Fertile Highlands"
 fertile_highlands_desc:0 "Fertile plains located on elevated and uneven terrain. Productive, rich soil hosts limited amount of trees and is ridden with rock formations and steeps. Good place for cultivation despite high altitudes and terrain that is hard to traverse and build on. While not as good for production as grasslands or farmlands, those lands are much better to defend."
