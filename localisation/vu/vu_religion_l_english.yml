 mormon_religion_desc: "Mormonism, or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, is a sect of Christianity started by Joseph Smith in the 1820s and 1830s. Joseph Smith claimed to see God the father and Jesus in a vision, where they told him that every church was misguided. They instructed him to reestablish the Christian Church as it was intended to be. Facing persecution from fellow protestants, Smith and his followers fled their home in upstate New York and founded a settlement near the Great Salt Lake in what is now Utah, establishing a new bastion for their new Church. In 1444 the religion does not yet exist, but it will arise once Christians colonize the American West."
