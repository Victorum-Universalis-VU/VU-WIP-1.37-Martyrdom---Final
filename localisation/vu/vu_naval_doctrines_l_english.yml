 kriegsmarine_desc:0 "For many years our neighbours have held dominance over the seas, commanding our coastal waters along with important and lucrative trade routes that could otherwise benefit and contribute to our nations survival; This is why it is high time that we come up with a solution. Hence, the time has come for our military to have its own war fleet, a 'Kriegsmarine' that will not only be tasked with defending our sovereign waters but also as a new means for our country to assert its own national interests in waters far beyond our shores through diplomacy or force if necessary."

 imperial_navy_desc:0 "The newly arrived 'Nanban' and foreigners on our shores have given us and our nation two choices. Either we open up its doors to trade with the West or keep it shut and incurr the wrath of the Great Powers. Instead of seeing these demands as threats, let us open up Japan and invite nanban innovators and scientist so that we too can build up our defences in order to avert any more possible humiliation and potential defeat."
