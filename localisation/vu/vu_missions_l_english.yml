Later attacks were launched from the southeast as well, so that by the 1st century CE the entire peninsula was under Roman control. At the height of Roman power, the Balkan peoples were the most united of any time in their history, with a common legal system, a single ultimate arbiter of political power, and absolute military security. In addition, a vibrant commerce was conducted along the Via Egnatia, a great east-west land route that led from Dyrrhachium (modern Durres, Albania) through Macedonia to Thessalonica (modern Thessaloniki, Greece) and on to Thrace. The northwestern part of the peninsula, including Dalmatia along the Adriatic coast as well as Pannonia around the Danube and Sava rivers, became the province of Illyricum. What is now eastern Serbia was incorporated into Moesia, which reached farther eastward between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube all the way to the Black Sea. The southeastern part of the peninsula was ruled as Thrace, and the southern part was brought into Macedonia."

Into this picture came the rising general Julius Caesar, who had ensured himself the position of Governor of both Transalpine and Cisalpine Gaul. He sought to pay off debts and find glory for himself, and so began a series of aggressive campaigns to conquer the Gallic tribes. In 51 BC and 50 BC, there was little resistance and Caesar's troops were mostly mopping up. Gaul was conquered, although it would not become a Roman province until 27 BC, and resistance would continue until as late as 70 AD. There is no clear end-date for the war, but the imminent Roman Civil War led to the withdrawal of Caesar's troops in 50 BC. Caesar's wild successes in the war had made him extremely wealthy and provided a legendary reputation. The Gallic Wars were a key factor in Caesar's ability to win the Civil War and declare himself dictator, in what would eventually lead to the end of the Roman Republic and the establishment of the Roman Empire."

He soon formed his own ceta (hajduk band) and started a violent fight against the Ottomans. His strong personality and military prowess made him a man of many followers and his guerrillas became a strong fighting force. The oldest mention of Novak is from 1595, when he was mentioned in the forces of Wallachian prince Michael the Brave. Novak joined the forces of Michael in the region of Banat, and received the rank of captain with 2,000 Serbian hajduks (brigands) under his command, set to liberate the Wallachian lands. His forces participated in the seizure of Calugareni, and liberated Targoviste, Bucharest, and Giurgiu in October 1595. His forces were part of the attack on Bulgarian Sofia which earned him great reputation after he and his 700 soldiers tricked the Turks by changing route through the Balkan mountains and successfully surprise-attacked the Turkish forces only leaving behind 8 of his soldiers and capturing vast amounts of livestock and supplies from the Ottomans.

By the 17th century they were firmly established in the Ottoman Balkans, owing to increased taxes, Christian victories against the Ottomans, and a general decline in security. Hajduk bands predominantly numbered one hundred men each, with a firm hierarchy under one leader. They targeted Ottoman representatives and rich people, mainly rich Turks, for plunder or punishment to oppressive Ottomans, or revenge or a combination of all. In Balkan folkloric tradition, the hajduk (hajduci or haiduci in the plural) is a romanticised hero figure who steals from, and leads his fighters into battle against, the Ottoman authorities. They are comparable to the English legendary Robin Hood and his merry men, who stole from the rich (who as in the case of the haiduci happened to also be foreign occupiers) and gave to the poor, while defying seemingly unjust laws and authority. People that helped hajduks were called jataks. Jataks lived in villages and towns and provided food and shelter for hajduks. In return, hajduks would give them part of the loot."

Deleanu's Tiganiada (Gypsy Epic) (which was published only in 1875, almost a century after its composition) presented Vlad as a hero fighting against the boyars, Ottomans, strigoi (or vampires), and other evil spirits at the head of an army of gypsies and angels."

Starting in 1185, the Bulgarians and Vlachs living in the region revolted against the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II. After the success of the uprising, it became the core of the Second Bulgarian Empire.

Now, each with their own crown spearheading the conflict between Christianity and Islam, it is only natural that Vlad would see Constantinople, Mehmed's greatest conquest and the seat of Orthodoxy as the ultimate symbol of his triumph over his rival. With Tsarigrad, the city coveted by Bulgarian-Vlach emperors, Serbs emperors and the crusaders alike, now firmly in the shadow of the Wallachian Aquila of Basarab's house, the Voievode can claim for himself the legacy of the Caesars."

Your boyars have failed you, so now you turn to God and Voievode! And yet you do not plead? You do not kneel to dust your heads with ash? Instead you wail, "Why has God forsaken us?" We must look into the trials we failed long ago! In a time past, after the death of Mircea the Great we have allowed unholy forces to slip into our domains. The offspring of our inaction was the rise of the Ottomans and Islam... Yet we did not banish it, instead studying their vile language and religion for our own power and wealth! And the monsters at our door... the unholy infidels who abduct our young for their jannisary corps ? Did we raise our swords against them? Or did we lay our burden on others? The so-called Hajduks... Filthy bandits impersonating folk heroes, their souls tainted through blasphemous ritual. Sent to fight the heathens or our bretheren for whomever pays better... they could not distinguish good from evil. Yes, their numbers have dwindled throughout the years. But still few roam our lands, offering their bloody work for coin. To this day they shame us with their very existence! Wallachia bleeds, flogged by war! The battles are Gods' whip, chastisement for our sins! And let us not forget the terrors, the scourges from beyond our world! The Strigoi rule the skies with every full moon! The dark raiders abduct our children into lands unknown! Some say they herald the Apocalipse! Can we chart a course back into the light? Will we find the strength to banish heathens from our kingdom? Unite around the warmth of the Holly Spirit? Nigh is the Time of the Sword and Axe! None will fight this war in our stead! Nigh is the Time of Madness and Disdain!"

Since the middle of the 19th century, Romanian historians have treated Vlad as one of the greatest Romanian rulers, emphasizing his fight for the independence of the Romanian lands. Even Vlad's acts of cruelty were often represented as rational acts serving national interest. Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol was one of the first historians to emphasize that Vlad could only stop the internal fights of the boyar parties through his acts of terror. Constantin C. Giurescu remarked, 'The tortures and executions which Vlad ordered were not out of caprice, but always had a reason, and very often a reason of state'."

Vlad II had won the moniker "Dracul" for his membership in the Order of the Dragon."
 war_with_mehmet_title:0 "War Against Mehmet"
 war_with_mehmet_desc:0 "In 1459 , Vlad Tepes refused to pay tribute to the Turks (10,000 guldens annually). It seems that this rebellion was due to the existence of a project of a crusade against the Ottomans, a crusade supported by the Pope and in which the king of Hungary, Matias Corvinus , would have played the main role (he even receives from the Pope the sum of 40,000 guldens, enough to team 12,000 men and 10 warships). In this political context, Vlad Tepes concluded an alliance with Matei Corvinus, probably at the beginning of 1460 , which the Ottomans would have wanted to prevent. Moreover, they will try, through Hamza Pasha, the bey of Nicopole, and the sultan's deacon, Catavolinos, to catch Vlad by trickery, but without success. Once the Ottoman plans were thwarted and punished (the two were impaled along with all the Turkish soldiers accompanying them), Vlad Tepes organized a surprise campaign south of the Danube in the winter of 1461-1462."

He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included "not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents." Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000.The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback—who were few in numbers—were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that "it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me"

It was fashioned after the military orders of the Crusades, requiring its initiates to defend the cross and fight the enemies of Christianity, particularly the Ottoman Empire. The Order flourished during the first half of the 15th century, primarily in Germany and Italy. After Sigismund's death in 1437, its importance declined in Western Europe. However, after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, it continued to play a role in Hungary, Serbia and Romania, which bore the brunt of the Ottoman incursions. The Prince of Wallachia Vlad II Dracul, the father of Vlad the Impaler, took his name from the Order of the Dragon."
 transylvanian_claims_title:0 "Transylvanian Claims"
 transylvanian_claims_desc:0 "Works containing the stories about Vlad's cruelty were published in Low German in the Holy Roman Empire before 1480. The stories were allegedly written in the early 1460s, because they describe Vlad's campaign across the Danube in early 1462, but they do not refer to Mehmed II's invasion of Wallachia in June of the same year. They provide a detailed narration of the conflicts between Vlad and the Transylvanian Saxons, showing that they originated "in the literary minds of the Saxons". The stories about Vlad's plundering raids in Transylvania were clearly based on an eyewitness account, because they contain accurate details (including the lists of the churches destroyed by Vlad and the dates of the raids). They describe Vlad as a "demented psychopath, a sadist, a gruesome murderer, a masochist", worse than Caligula and Nero. However, the stories emphasizing Vlad's cruelty are to be treated with caution because his brutal acts were very probably exaggerated (or even invented) by the Saxons. The invention of movable type printing contributed to the popularity of the stories about Vlad, making them one of the first "bestsellers" in Europe. To enhance sales, they were published in books with woodcuts on their title pages that depicted horrific scenes. For instance, the editions published in Nuremberg in 1499 and in Strasbourg in 1500 depict Vlad dining at a table surrounded by dead or dying people on poles."
