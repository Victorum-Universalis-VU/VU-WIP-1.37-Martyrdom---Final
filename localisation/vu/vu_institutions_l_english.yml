 desc_feudalism:0 "Over time most societies develop a need for a common structure with stronger and more permanent institutions of government. After the fall of the Roman Empire this need came to be filled by a number of institutions and customs that taken together are often considered to be part of the European Feudal system. For similar reasons permanent government and societal systems have formed all over the world, some of which have roots that go far further back than Feudalism itself.\nUnlike the other Institutions 'Feudalism' covers a wide range of different systems and exists from the start in all parts of the world where a strong tradition of Urbanism, Institutionalized Government and Social Stratification has reached a critical point. The institution can spread from contact with any of these cultures, or in some cases begin to grow on its own in a society that fulfills certain criteria."
 desc_gunpowder_warfare:0 "Ever since its invention in China, in 9th century, gunpowder has been gradually adopted into military tactics of countries who could afford it. Utilizing its immense power and potential was a true game-changer on a battle field, especially against those who didn't have it. Its use was originally not much sophisticated, limited to stationary explosives only, but later in the medieval era would see its first experimentation with bombards and small arms. The explosive power of gunpowder would first be mastered during sieges where the stationary nature of the situation would allow for successfull experimentation. In the later middle ages, the progress in engineering and metallurgy would gradually reduce the size and bulkness of gunpowder weapons making them not only more versatile in use but much more deadly and effective. At last, the gunpowder would spread west from China towards Europe mostly due to Mongol conquests. It would be the Europe which would then carry on the art of mastering those weapons."
 desc_medicine:0 "Islamic Golden Age, Great House of Wisdom, development of herbalism and alchemy, progress in biology and increase in public awareness has lead to the development of first cataloqued medicine and medical practise. Different works on medicine were created independently in many regions of the world but most revolutionary advancements for the treatment in the middle ages can be pointed to knowledge gathered by Muslim scholars during Islamic Golden Age. From now on, systematical medical practise, gradually spread across Europe and Asia when it wa further improved and developed over time to serve as a base for another revolution during enlightment. Ultimately, foundations for the true modern medicine were created in the coming centuries."
 desc_civil_service:0 "Civil Service, also including Chivalry in Western Europe. Add description later."
 desc_market_production:0 "Market Production and merchant class emerging as the development of trade routes, artisans, towns, workshops, trade leagues and organized exchange emerges in developed parts of the world. \nBasically, whatever the Hanseatic League and its merchants were doing. \nAdd more decsription later."
 desc_renaissance:0 "Since the 14th century the wealthy and powerful in the Italian City states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Classical philosophers. Renaissance Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance Humanist is an expert on everything from Politics and Philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
 desc_new_world_i:0 "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, it has led to a spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vast size of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Atlantic the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy and as foreign lands and people are mapped and documented ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate has become more and more colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth and from Valladolid to Fatehpur Sikri the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 desc_printing_press:0 "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways the early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as Venetian Printer Aldus Manutius, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures.\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout Europe editions have grown and hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from Religious and Political pamphlets to instructions in how to behave or scientific treatises are circulating the continent. With Print Shops growing evermore commonplace rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 desc_global_trade:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the pacific ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English Merchants and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."
 desc_manufactories:0 "While a number of technical innovations during the course of the 16th and 17th centuries has increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating Manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that prevent mass production in principle as well as pioneer ways to increase production through organizing and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
 desc_enlightenment:0 "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications or coffee houses kings, scientists, philosophers and litterateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method and the spreading of enlightenment ideals to all humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs expeditions are being sent to measure, catalogue, weigh and map the world so that we can better understand the laws that govern the things around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the Rights of Men.\nGreat projects such as the colossal undertaking of creating a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge or a complete index of all plants, animals and fungi in the world are being pursued for the greater good of humanity. The Light of Reason has been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."

 desc_imperialism:0 "In historical contexts, New Imperialism characterizes a period of colonial expansion by European powers, the United States, and Japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The period featured an unprecedented pursuit of overseas territorial acquisitions. At the time, states focused on building their empires with new technological advances and developments, making their territory bigger through conquest, and exploiting the resources of the subjugated countries. During the era of New Imperialism, the Western powers (and Japan) individually conquered almost all of Africa and parts of Asia. The new wave of imperialism reflected ongoing rivalries among the great powers, the economic desire for new resources and markets."
 
 desc_industrialization:0 "The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1750 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British."
 desc_nationalism_institution:0 "Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one's nation. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the first half of the 19th century, and was actively promoted by the European governments and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed and adopted. The political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the national revolutions of Europe, such as the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history."
