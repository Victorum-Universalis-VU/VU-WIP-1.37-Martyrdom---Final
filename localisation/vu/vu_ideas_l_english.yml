 gunpowder_empire_mug: "Mughal Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_mug_desc: "The Mughal Sultan Babur had employed Ottoman expert Ustad Ali Quli, who showed Babur the standard Ottoman formation—artillery and firearm-equipped infantry protected by wagons in the center, and mounted archers on both wings. Babur used this formation at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Afghan and Rajput forces loyal to the Delhi sultanate, though superior in numbers but without the gunpowder weapons, were soundly defeated.\n\nThe decisive victory of the Timurid forces is one reason opponents rarely met Mughal princes in pitched battle over the course of the empire's history. The reign of Akbar The Great, Shah Jahan and the Islamic Aurangzeb, represented the height of gunpowder use in Mughal history."

After Abbas the Great reformed the army (around 1598), the Safavid forces had an artillery corps of 500 cannons as well as 12,000 musketeers.\n\nThe Safavids first put their gunpowder arms to good use against the Uzbeks, who had invaded eastern Persia during the civil war that followed the death of Ismail I. Their use would continue and thanks to these weapons, the Ottomans would no longer manage to secure another decisive victory against the Persians as they had at Chaldiran."
 gunpowder_empire_tur: "Ottoman Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_tur_desc: "By the 15th century, use of gunpowder weapons propelled the Ottoman army as one of the strongest in the world. Their siege engines proved their worth in the successful siege of Salonica in 1430 and of Constantinople in 1453. The Janissaries had been an infantry bodyguard using bows and arrows. During the rule of Sultan Mehmed II they were drilled with firearms and became perhaps the first standing infantry force equipped with firearms in the world.\n\nThe combination of artillery and Janissary firepower proved decisive at Varna in 1444 against a force of Crusaders, Baskent in 1473 against the Aq Qoyunlu, and Mohacs in 1526 against Hungary. But the battle which convinced the Safavids and the Mughals of the efficacy of gunpowder was Chaldiran in 1514, which led to the sack of the Safavid capital of Tabriz."

This was the vision of our great leader and founder Simon Bolivar, who gave us independence and sought to give us unity."
 COL_idea3: "Centralization Efforts"
 COL_idea3_desc: "Colombia was constituted as a unitary centralist state, and from the beginning its existence was marked by a struggle between those who supported a centralized government with a strong presidency and those who supported a decentralized, federal form of government.

 PRG_idea1_desc: "Paraguay was an important center of colonization and spread of European technology and ideas among the natives, chiefly the Guarani, until Spain's bigotry and aggression caused massive depopulation and isolation with the rest of South America. Though Asuncion was one of the first cities in the southern area of the continent to achieve importance, it was outclassed by subsequently established cities because of Spain's actions. Now that we are again independent and free, it is time to reassert our hegemony over the area."
 PRG_idea2: "Legacy of the Jesuits"
 PRG_idea2_desc: "Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions, where the Guaraní people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions. These reductions were built to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the Bandeirantes, in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the syncretic religion has absorbed native elements. The reducciones flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, and it represents a defining moment for our nation and culture."
 PRG_idea3: "Develop the Land"
 PRG_idea3_desc: "The woodlands and hills of Paraguay have been the home of our ancestors for many years but prove a challenging environment: many colonists tried their fortune here only to be hampered by the harshness of the environment, a lack of proper supplies and an overconfidence of their own superiority. We, however, have mixed Guarani and European knowledge to be able to live and develop the land efficiently."
 PRG_idea4: "Protectionism and Centralism"
 PRG_idea4_desc: "Surrounded by many competitors it is important to extert control on all exports. Our government must follow protectionism, never accept loans from abroad and levy high tariffs against imported foreign products.

 CUB_idea5: "Cuban Fleet"

Just as the hill's fortifications have protected us in the past, they shall do so again."
 TNV_idea3: "Centers of Learning"
 TNV_idea3_desc: "Prior to the Turkish invasions, Tarnovo was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School, painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School, and to literature. It is important to restore these great centers of learning to their former glory if we don't want to be left behind."
 TNV_idea4: "Banks of the Yantra"

These columns were placed in the church by Ivan Asen II as a tribute to his mighty ancestors."
 TNV_idea6: "Indomitable Will"
 TNV_idea6_desc: "Tarnovo remained the centre of resistance against the Ottoman empire long after the fall of Bulgaria, with several uprisings beginning from the city itself, particularly those of 1598, 1686 and - lastly - 1876. Even as the Ottomans continued to oppress Bulgaria, this only hardened the spirits of the patriots wishing to see the nation reborn anew.

 BDN_idea2: "Baba Vida"
 BDN_idea2_desc: "Vidin's main landmark, the Baba Vida fortress, was built in the period from the 10th to the 14th century, and served as the city's main defensive installation during the course of the Middle Ages and acted as the most important fortress of northwestern Bulgaria."
 BDN_idea3: "Defend against Serbia"
 BDN_idea3_desc: "Many times throughout history the Serbian kings to the west have desired to add Vidin and the surrounding areas to their possessions: even today we can never know when they will strike again. It is important to have a mobile army capable of intercepting them before they lay siege to the city once again."
 BDN_idea4: "Echoes of Freedom"
 BDN_idea4_desc: "Even after the Ottomans captured Vidin in 1388 and forced the then ruler Sratsimir to become their vassal, the Bulgarians soon rose up in revolt and joined the fight against the Ottomans at the Battle of Nicopolis. Though it ended in disaster, this shows us that in order to win the path towards freedom we need to use subterfuge, and allow us to act against the Turks even if nominally vassals."
 BDN_idea5: "Buffer Zone"
 BDN_idea5_desc: "Between the 15th and 18th centuries Vidin acted as a buffer zone in the centuries-long wars between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. Repeated punitive expeditions by the Austrians and brutal crackdowns by the Ottomans depopulated the city at several times, yet, we were always able to rise up again from the ashes. No matter the enemy, we shall never waver in our resolve."
 BDN_idea6: "Martyrs on the Altar"
 BDN_idea6_desc: "In 1806, during the rule of former Janissary Osman Pazvantoglu, he captured several hundred laymen and priests from Vidin and the surrounding areas, and imprisoned the priests and Bishop Kalinik in the Church of St. Peter, and later slaughtered them before the altar. The martyrdom of the holy men reminds us to never waver in our faith and determination to maintain independence."
 BDN_idea7: "The Defense of Vidin"
 BDN_idea7_desc: "During the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885, repeated attempts to conquer Vidin by the Kingdom of Serbia failed, and its successful defense of the city, organized by Atanas Uzunov, allowed the Bulgarian army to go on the offensive and win the war decisively in Bulgaria's favor."

In the middle of the century, this also happened with Dobruja, which the Bulgarian boyar Balik , with the help of his brothers Theodor and Dobrotitsa, turned into an independent feudal principality with Karvuna as its capital. Knowing that destiny is in our hands rather than that of distant overlords gives our people newfound security."
 DRJ_idea2: "Breadbasket of Eastern Bulgaria"
 DRJ_idea2_desc: "As a traditional breadbasket, Dobruja supplied wheat to Constantinople mostly via the major ports of Varna and Kaliakra frequented by the Genoese and Venetian fleets.

 DRJ_idea3: "Monetary Independence"

 DRJ_idea7: "Allies Overseas"

 VBZ_idea2: "Multi-ethnic Society"
 VBZ_idea2_desc: "Macedonia has seen many different peoples settle in the area, from Greeks to Illyrians, from Bulgarians to Serbs. Even though the area has a significant Bulgarian majority today it is still important that we maintain harmony between rulers and subjects, irrespective of their country of origin."
 VBZ_idea3: "Rugged Landscape"
 VBZ_idea3_desc: "Macedonia is a rugged landscape with several mountains and hills, all of which contribute to warfare in this area being quite difficult. Fortunately, this also means that our troops have had enough experience in mastering such landscapes and do not suffer as much attrition from it."
 VBZ_idea4: "Coin Minting in Macedonia"
 VBZ_idea4_desc: "As independent rulers of Velbazhd, the Dragas brothers had their own government and minted coins according to the Nemanjic style. These actions allowed the despotate to achieve not just stability but also legitimacy by using tried and trued methods of past dynasties."

 SZK_idea1_desc: "Famed by many, feared by all, our people have been guarding the eastern border of the Kingdom of Hungary for generations. Under our watch, no invader shall ever conquer the lands of Transylvania."
 SZK_idea2: "Warrior Castes"
 SZK_idea2_desc: "Our society is split into three groups. The commoners (or pixidarii) hold small parcels of land and fight as foot soldiers. The wealthier primipili act as mounted warriors. Finally, the high-ranking primores represent the highest hierarchy in Székely society."
 SZK_idea3: "Széks"
 SZK_idea3_desc: "The Székely administrative units were known as széks (or seats) from the middle of the 14th century. Each seat was headed by two elected officials, the lieutenant (maior exercitus) and the seat judge (iudex terrestris). Theoretically, lieutenants were responsible for the military affairs and seat judges administered justice, but lieutenants also heard legal disputes. Both seat judges and lieutenants heard disputes together with twelve jurors."
 SZK_idea4: "Resisting Centralization"
 SZK_idea4_desc: "Stephen Báthory, Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys, made several attempts to reduce the autonomy of the seats in the early 1490s, accusing many primores of high treason. He confiscated their estates and forced Székely heiresses to marry his retainers. Fortunately, through perseverance and persuasion, we have convinced the King of Hungary to replace this troublesome official. This precedent well shows us that the path to lasting prosperity lies in the pen as much as it does in the sword."
 SZK_idea5: "Push Back the Turks"
 SZK_idea5_desc: "The Ottoman armies push deeper and deeper into Carpathia and threaten to put an end to our autonomy after their victories against the Hungarian Army. We must be opportunistic and choose our allies wisely during these troubling times. Michael the Brave of Romania would be a powerful ally to have..."
 SZK_idea6: "Trouble in Transylvania"
 SZK_idea6_desc: "Repeated attempts by the Habsburg monarchy to incorporate Transylvania have not gone unnoticed among the Székelys and many are anxious to defend our homeland against these arrogant conquerors. As we can no longer count on the protection of the old Kingdom of Hungary it is important to assert our control over the entirety of Carpathia in order to defend the frontier from the enemy rather than our doorstep."
 SZK_idea7: "Remembering the Siculicidium"
 SZK_idea7_desc: "The accursed Habsburg armies treacherously slaughtered over 400 of our brothers and sisters at Csík-Madéfalva, where the Székely leaders were supposed to meet in a council. We must not forget this defeat and never allow our will to be broken."

 KYL_idea5_desc: "Under the influence of Johannes Honterus, the great majority of the Transylvanian Saxons embraced the new creed of Martin Luther during the Protestant Reformation. One of the consequences of the Reformation was the emergence of an almost perfect equivalence, in the Transylvanian context, of the terms Lutheran and Saxon, with the Lutheran Church in Transylvania being de facto a 'Volkskirche', i.e. the 'national church' of the Transylvanian Saxons."
 KYL_idea6: "German Weaponry"

 AVR_idea3_desc: "Avar settlements often consist of a single complex building, where the concept of separate ownership, of the integrity and unity of a building is not seen; an entire quarter — perhaps even the whole aul (mountain village) — may consist of a single building, in the sense of an unbroken, continuous structure. Nowhere as in Avaria does the density of houses reach such concentration, where the streets and thoroughfares run like tunnels, sometimes at two levels below the houses, and the densely-packed houses form one great, indivisible amalgamation. The compactness of building was dictated by the necessities of agricultural economy and of defense."
 AVR_idea4: "Shield of the Mountains"
 AVR_idea4_desc: "In the fourteenth century Tamerlane, 'the Conqueror of the Universe,'' left the mountains, having suffered enormous losses after invading Avaria with a host of 100,000. Let his successors, or any other invader, try again and they shall be met sword in hand!"

 DRB_idea1_desc: "Derbent claims to be the oldest city in Russia with historical documentation dating to the 8th century BCE. The 20-meter-high (66 ft) walls with thirty north-looking towers are believed to belong to the time of Kavadh's son, Khosrau I, who also directed the construction of Derbent's fortress."
 DRB_idea2: "Multicultural City"
 DRB_idea2_desc: "Ancient Iranian language elements were absorbed into the everyday speech of the population of Dagestan and Derbent especially during the Sassanian era, and many remain current. A deliberate policy of \"Persianizing\" Derbent and the eastern Caucasus in general can be traced over many centuries, from Khosrow I to the Safavid shahs Ismail I, and Abbås the Great. According to the account in the later \"Darband-nama\", after construction of the fortifications Khosrow I \"moved much folk here from Persia\", relocating about 3,000 families from the interior of Persia in the city of Derbent and neighboring villages."
 DRB_idea3: "The Forty Heroes"

To the south lies the seaward extremity of the Caucasian wall (fifty metres long), otherwise known as Alexander's Wall, blocking the narrow pass of the Iron Gate or Caspian Gates (Portae Athanae or Portae Caspiae). When intact, the wall had a height of 9 m (29 ft) and a thickness of about 3 m (10 ft) and, with its iron gates and numerous watch-towers, defended Persia's frontier."

According to Arab historians, Derbent, with population exceeding 50,000, was the largest city of the 9th century Caucasus. In the 10th century, with the collapse of the Arab Caliphate, Derbent became the capital of an emirate. This emirate often fought losing wars with the neighboring Christian state of Sarir, allowing Sarir to manipulate Derbent's politics on occasion. Despite that, the emirate outlived its rival and continued to flourish at the time of the Mongol invasion in 1239."
 DRB_idea6: "Caspian Crossing"
 DRB_idea6_desc: "Derbent's location on a narrow, three-kilometer strip of land in the North Caucasus between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains is strategic in the entire Caucasus region. This position allows the rulers of Derbent to control land traffic between the Eurasian Steppe and the Middle East. The only other practicable crossing of the Caucasus ridge is over the Darial Gorge."
 DRB_idea7: "Upgrade the Fortifications"

 VOL_idea1: "A Union, Reborn"

 VOL_idea2: "Seeking a Compromise"
 VOL_idea2_desc: "Our lands are a crossroads between East and West, and with this comes the fact many of our people follow different branches of Christianity. It is thus important that we enact a policy of tolerance in order to ensure the loyalty of our subjects."
 VOL_idea3: "Consolidating our Borders"
 VOL_idea3_desc: "Facing enemies east and west, north and south, it is imperative that we once again assert our ownership over these disputed lands, as we have done before in the past. Even if our enemies end up teaming up against us, by maintaining an effective administration over our territories we will undoubtedly prevail."
 VOL_idea4: "A Dynastic Legacy"
 VOL_idea4_desc: "In times, past our kings did the seemingly impossible in uniting people of different creeds and allegiances under one crown, and today, it is time for us to continue that path. In times, past our kings did the seemingly impossible in uniting people of different creeds and allegiances under one crown, and today, it is time for us to continue that path."
 VOL_idea5: "Development of Commerce"
 VOL_idea5_desc: "Centuries ago, commerce in Galicia-Volhynia developed due to trade routes linking the Black Sea with Poland, Germany, and the Baltic basin under control of the crown. The Mongol invasions devastated these trade routes and led to the opening of new ones, but it is high time that we reestablish our prominence in regional trade."
 VOL_idea6: "The Galician - Volhynian Chronicle"
 VOL_idea6_desc: "Culture and literature flourished during the reign of Danylo, leading to the creation of the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle, an important history book detailing the history of the principality. Further pursuing an interest in the arts will continue to guarantee our kingdom's position in history."
 VOL_idea7: "A Look Westwards"
 VOL_idea7_desc: "Traditionally, there was much intermarriage between the princely houses of Galicia and those of neighboring Catholic countries, and Galicia-Volhynia more often than not looked westward for inspiration and allies, in contrast to other Kievan Rus' successors like Novgorod. We must continue this practice, which will most likely also allow us to gain new powerful military techniques to employ on the battlefield."

 AFA_idea2: "Unity in Division"
 AFA_idea2_desc: "Our society traditionally consists of several melas, or tribes, which have long been in conflict with eachother and all of our neighbors. Now that we have found political unity however, it is time to forget past grievances and focus on our mission of independence and prosperity. As long as we keep our identity at heart, they will never succeed in dividing us for good."
 AFA_idea3: "Trading in the Desert"
 AFA_idea3_desc: "Not much of our land is suitable for coltivation, and as a result the majority of our economy revolves around pastoralism. However, there are many useful resources in the desert. We have long practiced salt mining in the Danakil, a highly sought commodity by outsiders, and by taking part in the ever growing slave trade, we will be sure to obtain a position of relevance in trade in the Red Sea."
 AFA_idea4: "Martial Prowess"

 AFA_idea6_desc: "Our people for a long time have lived under isolated, fractured sultanates. Now that we have centralized our government, many of the former techniques employed by the previous sultanates have been expanded resulting in a more efficient government that can better regulate the oftentimes difficult trades our people are involved in."

 HAR_idea4: "Protecting our Wealth"

 HAR_idea6: "A Look Inwards"
 HAR_idea6_desc: "With our expansion comes new problems and questions. Can we really trust the new people we have subjected under our rule? Can we trust them not to stab ourselves in the back at the first opportunity? Maybe we should convince them to leave... or maybe we should accept them instead. "
 HAR_idea7: "Trade of the Horn"
 HAR_idea7_desc: "In our newfound position as one of the leading powers in the region, we can put our skills as merchants and craftmen to the ultimate test. It is time to ensure that we have a monopoly on all the trade going through this region, or how else will we be able to maintain what we have achieved so far?"

 FOE_idea2: "Island Hopping"

 FOE_idea3: "Bridge the Gap"
 FOE_idea3_desc: "There are other communities which have been heavily influenced by Norse culture and customs, but which have for a long time been under the oppressive yoke of foreigners.

Our independence ensures that such horrible practices shall no longer affect our abilities to trade with whoever we want."
 FOE_idea6: "From Throne to Throne"
 FOE_idea6_desc: "We have been under control of both Norway and Denmark throughout our history, and both kingdoms applied pressure to sway us over to their side over the other. It is important that we establish efficient diplomatic corps in order to relate to other nations as equals, instead of as subjects."

 CNL_idea2: "Frontier Defense"
 CNL_idea2_desc: "Carniola has historically been important as a defensive position to deter aggression from raiders in the east.

 CNL_idea3: "Imperial Legacy"
 CNL_idea3_desc: "The administration of Carniola has for a long time been conducted by important rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, but these were invariably of foreign extraction. Now that we have asserted our independence we can employ the methods used by those administrators, but for our own benefit rather than theirs."

 CNL_idea4_desc: "In the late 15th century, as part of the Habsburg westward expansion, the Duchy of Carniola acquired many new territories: Idrija, Duino and the surrounding parts of the Karst Plateau, Kastav, Opatija, and the interior areas of Istria, centered around Pazin. This shows us that in order to acquire more wealth and security it is important to expand our borders."
 CNL_idea5: "Arrival of the Reformation"
 CNL_idea5_desc: "The unity of Western Christianity has been shaken by the Reformation that started in the Empire. While we have been warned not to trust these new ideas, we have seen that some of their preachers are also interested in helping our national cause. Following the first books in Slovene were written by the Protestant preacher Primož Trubar and his followers, establishing the base for the development of standard Slovene. In the second half of the 16th century, numerous books were printed in Slovene, including an integral translation of the Bible by Jurij Dalmatin. As long as such works are made, perhaps it's best we tolerate them?"
 CNL_idea6: "Sailing the Mediterranean"

 EGY_idea2: "Brow of Eternity"

 EGY_idea3: "Red Sea Trade"
 EGY_idea3_desc: "Egypt is one of the world's key trade hubs, for trade over land and maritime trade alike. This role has remained unchanged over thousands of years, no matter which conqueror controlled the lands at the time. It is very important that we take advantage of this peculiar position and monopolize trade from the Mediterranean and Asia."
 EGY_idea4: "Monuments to Greatness"
 EGY_idea4_desc: "Few, if any, places in the world can lay claim to having such a rich cultural heritage as Egypt. The quantity of temples, Cathedrals, Mosques and other examples of spectacular architecture have been renowed since antiquity and continue to be a source of great pride for all that have ruled this land, including us."
 EGY_idea5: "Across the Nile"
 EGY_idea5_desc: "The Nile river not only gives us food and wealth, but it can also used to quickly transport our armies across the region. This process will allow us to quickly respond to approaching enemies from all sides, South and North, East and West."
 EGY_idea6: "Build the Suez Canal"

 EGY_idea7: "Source of the Nile"
 EGY_idea7_desc: "For centuries many have asked themselves where the exact source of the great Nile river is. We do not yet have an answer to that question but it is obvious that to satisfy it, it is necessary to conquest the lands south of Upper Egypt.

Distracted as they were by their feud they grossly underestimated our strength and resolve, and this migration will change our destiny forever."
 JIM_idea2: "Unite the Clans"
 JIM_idea2_desc: "There are many Oromo clans living in the region, some of which maintain hostile relations between themselves, and live in remarkably different lifestyles as some are pastoralists and others have developed agriculture. The time has come to put our differences behind and unite the clans into one powerful nation."
 JIM_idea3: "Gadaa"
 JIM_idea3_desc: "The Gadaa system of governance has maintained authority and discpline among our people for centuries. In it, each class, or luba, consists of all of the sons of the men in another particular class. The entire class progresses through eleven different grades, each based on an eight-year cycle, and each with its own set of rights and responsibilities."
 JIM_idea4: "Bokkuu, Duulaa and Sa'aa"

 JIM_idea5: "Resilent Warriors"
 JIM_idea5_desc: "The Ethiopian Empire launched a series of punitive expeditions against our expansion, and even though their accursed armies were oftentimes successful, we have managed to learn a lot from their tactics and our army is now way better prepared to face Imperial divisions in combat."
 JIM_idea6: "From Clansmen to Princes"
 JIM_idea6_desc: "Our continued influence in the region has allowed us to intervene in the politics of our powerful neighbors and several members of our nobility have become important princes in Ethiopia, ruling over vast swathes of land and controlling people of innumerable languages and faiths. But as long as these people are under our control they shall know who their real master is."
 JIM_idea7: "Beyond the Horn"
 JIM_idea7_desc: "With our rightful place as a regional power in the Horn of Africa secured, it is time to look outwards for new wealthy lands to conquer.

We have not however forgotten the way of the steppes, and our cavalrymen remain as fearsome as ever."
 JSC_idea2: "A New Home"
 JSC_idea2_desc: "We were granted exile by the King of Hungary in exchange for participating in the armies of his realm.

Even though we have now been reduced to refugees at the court of the Hungarian kings we still maintain some of the most powerful cavalry in Europe, which puts us in a priviledged position within Hungary."
 KUS_idea2: "All the King's Men"
 KUS_idea2_desc: "The Cuman cavalry proved a valuable asset in the Hungarian armies, but the King knows that he cannot treat us as mere slaves: we have deserted the field in times where the King had shown contempt for our demands, so he now knows to treat lightly. Our autonomy, however, will only continue as long as our armies continue to be effective on the battlefield, so we must ensure to always be in prime shape."

We pride ourselves on our autonomy even as we're surrounded by much greater states than us."
 VDN_idea2: "Bishophric of Verdun"
 VDN_idea2_desc: "At the beginning of the 4th century, Verdun was evangelized by Saint Sanctin who had the first church dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul built on Mount St. Vanne. It is at this point that our city became the seat of the bishopric of Verdun with Sanctin himself as its first bishop. This proud bishophric is still going strong to this day thanks to our piety and efficient management."
 VDN_idea3: "Flowering Trade"
 VDN_idea3_desc: "Verdun was always a prosperous city which traded in metals, wines, fabrics, cereals and spices with the countries in the north. Even as the Hundreds Years War weakened the region significantly it is clear that reaffirming our control over these profitable trade routes will bring Verdun much needed prosperity in these difficult times."
 VDN_idea4: "Center of Arts"
 VDN_idea4_desc: "During the Middle Ages Verdun built a reputation as a city of great importance to the arts, thanks to its goldsmithing and its production of illuminated manuscripts and Vitreous enamel. One of our most celebrated artists was Nicholas of Verdun, one of the most famous goldsmiths and enamelists of the Middle Ages. He was a major figure in Romanesque art, and the leading figure of Mosan art in his day, creating shrines, figurines and candlesticks decorated with precious stones and traveling around Europe to fulfill major commissions. His legacy and that of the other artists ensures that our city is one of major prestige thanks to attracting like-minded individuals."
 VDN_idea5: "The Free City of Verdun"
 VDN_idea5_desc: "Occupied by the war, the kings of France no longer take care of guarding our city, leaving the Empire to restore its authority there. In 1374, Verdun thus obtained the title of free city of Empire, placed under the direct supervision of the emperor. This newfound sense of security allowed us to develop our institutions and city."
 VDN_idea6: "French Influence"
 VDN_idea6_desc: "Even if the city remains a land of Empire and the bishop a Prince of Empire, the city is increasingly coming under French influence, because of the language, the origin of the bishops and religious orders, the style of architecture and the economy (use of currencies and commercial relations). In addition, the Holy Roman Empire's weak central leadership means a lack of protection for the territory of the cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun against looters. Perhaps our heart truly lies with France in the end, but separating the realms of France and Germany means it is in our best interests to maintain positive relations with both."
 VDN_idea7: "Fortify the City"
 VDN_idea7_desc: "From 1624 to 1636, a large bastioned citadel was constructed on the site of the Abbey of Saint Vanne. In 1670, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban visited Verdun and drew up an ambitious scheme to fortify the whole city. It is important that we carry out these schemes in order to make sure our city will be able to resist any siege until reinforcements arrive."

Today we are a proud republic, but any kind of government will work well in the hands of our capable administrators."
 MTZ_idea2: "Within the Empire"
 MTZ_idea2_desc: "The status of Free City in the empire grants us significant priviledges, and being situated at the crossroads between France and Germany brings important diplomatic opportunities. Because we have long been considered a buffer area, it is here that Emperor Charles IV in 1354 and 1356 held diets, promulgating the Golden Bull decree of 1356 , fixing important constitutional aspects of the Holy Roman Empire. Even if many might seem our priviledges as unfair advantages, it is important to keep working within the Empire for our own goals."

Even today many writers and thinkers flock to Metz for a variety of reasons. During the Reformation, French Renaissance writer François Rabelais came in Metz to escape the condemnation for heresy by the University of Paris. He wrote here his fourth book, in which he described a procession in the city with the Graoully's effigy."

Their adherents established a Gymnasium, headed by Johannes Sturm, made into a University in the following century. Strasbourg thus became a centre of humanist scholarship and early book-printing in the Holy Roman Empire, and its intellectual and political influence contributed much to the establishment of Protestantism as an accepted denomination in the southwest of Germany.

This makes our position crucial for anyone wishing to hold sway over these lands."
 ROC_idea3: "The Forts of Cyprus"

It is characterised by distinct design patterns, and its intricate, time-consuming production process. A genuine Lefkara lace with full embroidery can take typically hundreds of hours to be made, and that is why it is usually priced quite high.

 CRT_idea1_desc: "The island of Crete has been the seat of several important civilizations over the millennia, as our ancestors can trace back their roots to one of the very first civilizations of Europe. Throughout the long history of Crete many foreign powers have occupied it and the island has seen periods of importance alternating with periods of decline, but our pride in our roots and history remains steadfast."
 CRT_idea2: "The Big Blue"
 CRT_idea2_desc: "Naval power is key for anyone wishing to maintain a secure hold over the island of Crete, and we don't need to fight invaders on land if we can defeat their fleets first. It is therefore fundamental to our independence that we build several shipyards which shall allow us to quickly field navies in order to repel any seaborne invasion."
 CRT_idea3: "Jagged Landscape"
 CRT_idea3_desc: "The highly mountainous terrain of Crete presents a formidable obstacle to any invading army, and represents the main reason why many foreign powers could only hold temporary hold over the island. These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as Amari valley, fertile plateaus, such as Lasithi plateau, Omalos and Nidha; caves, such as Gourgouthakas, Diktaion, and Idaion, and a number of gorges."
 CRT_idea4: "Rebels in the Mountains"
 CRT_idea4_desc: "The mountains of Crete have been home to countless resistance movements over the years as our beautiful island struggled with repeated foreign occupation. The highlanders of Crete know the terrain better than anyone and have been able to form effective logistics and military bands that have ensured that Crete, deep down, will always remain independent until the end."
 CRT_idea5: "The Cretan School"
 CRT_idea5_desc: "The fall of Constantinople brought many Byzantine artists to seek refuge in Crete, which still remained in Christian hands. The presence of these artists and the heavy Western and especially Venetian influence led to the flowering of an art movement later referred to as the Cretan School, which remained the most prestigious form of Greek art for several centuries. The most prominent artist of this period was Doménikos Theotokópoulos, who expertly combined Eastern and Western techniques to produce highly innovative works. "
 CRT_idea6: "Riches of the Mediterranean"
 CRT_idea6_desc: "Crete has always been a haven for pirates and privateers, due to its central location in the Mediterranean giving it an extremely important position in the sea trade. The jagged coastlines of Crete provide ample hiding places for pirate vessels and while this could prove problematic to us, we may choose to employ some of these people to instead work for us."
 CRT_idea7: "Support the Greek Revolution"
 CRT_idea7_desc: "Just as we've had to struggle with foreign invaders, our Greek brothers in the motherland have launched a revolution to finally free themselves of foreign influence once and for all.

 GLC_idea2: "Shemyaka Hills"
 GLC_idea2_desc: "The early medieval earthen ramparts were further fortified in the early 15th and 16th centuries and have since become known as the Shemyaka Hills. These fortifications protect our city from our many enemies to the west and east as they seek to make Russia their own."
 GLC_idea3: "Galich Golden Age"
 GLC_idea3_desc: "The prosperity given to use by trade has allowed our city to prosper and acquire potential new buyers as our goods head to Moscow directly. Using this influence we will be able to further cement our role as one of the leading trade hubs in the region, outcompeting our rivals through reputation rather than brute strength."
 GLC_idea4: "The Fur Trade"
 GLC_idea4_desc: "Salt at this point is not the only good we have begun trading, as the many furs that arrive to us from the east are in high demand in the European market. These new trade routes for fur as well as the recently introduced commerce of fish ensure oru goods will arrive to far away lands and increase our reputation considerably."
 GLC_idea5: "Kazan Raids"
 GLC_idea5_desc: "As open war broke out between the principalities of Russia and the Kazan Sultanate to the East, the lands of Galich were subjected to heavy damage because of Kazan incursions into the region however, thanks to our fortifications, they were never able to take the city itself. As we were able to triumph in these difficult times it has become apparent to our people that we must never waver in our determination."
 GLC_idea6: "Orthodox Monasteries"
 GLC_idea6_desc: "Many monasteries dot the landscape in and around Galich. The most noteworthy one among them remains the Paisiev Monastery, founded in the early 14th century and featuring a 16th-century five-domed cathedral and a three-domed church from 1642. It is thanks to these wonderful monasteries that our people feel united in their faith."
 GLC_idea7: "On the Offensive"
 GLC_idea7_desc: "With the Kazan threat neutralized the importance of Galich as a defensive position declined. This however has not resulted in a loss of importance for us, and even though we are now safer from invasion we deem it fundamental to set up a strong army capable of taking the fight to the enemy rather than wait for them to pillage our lands again."

Continuing this development will confirm our status as a Scandinavian power."
 GTA_idea2: "Annex Smaland"
 GTA_idea2_desc: "Several small counties to the south enjoyed too much independence in times past and were therefore integrated into our kingdom, bringing us more wealth and allowing us to re-organize our administration. It is important to get these provinces back into the fold and utilize our administrative capabilities in order to further continue our expansion in Scandinavia."
 GTA_idea3: "Between Denmark and Sweden"
 GTA_idea3_desc: "The Kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden have by far become the dominant powers in Scandinavia, and both of them seek to influence the internal politics of Gotaland to their advantage. Through careful diplomatic maneuvers we have been trying to maintain our autonomy, for we are not Danish nor Swedish!"
 GTA_idea4: "Natural Barriers"
 GTA_idea4_desc: "As our agricultural communities are centered around the lakes, some other areas of our nation and especially the southern part are full of deep coniferous forest, and even though these hinder development of certain parts of our country they still provide a formidable defense against any invading force."
 GTA_idea5: "Trade in Kalmar"
 GTA_idea5_desc: "Great wealth passes through the Baltic Sea, and the city of Kalmar is strategically situated on the coastline of Smaland as one of the most important ports of Scandinavia. Through here pass many trade caravans and the city is quickly becoming a major center for export of iron. These commercial links are allowing us to become a real power in the Baltic Sea trade."
 GTA_idea6: "Seize the Islands"
 GTA_idea6_desc: "In order to affirm our role as the dominant power in the Baltic Sea it is of vital importance to seize many of the islands that are used as trading outposts and military strongholds, including Oland just off the coast but also Goatland and Bornholm. With these possessions and a strong fleet nobody will be able to match our might at sea."
 GTA_idea7: "Legend of Beowulf"
 GTA_idea7_desc: "The importance of our country is such that in England they have written a poem about a king of Goatland named Beowulf.

Our piety, education and generally benign treatment of the inhabitants are the source of great respect for our tribe."
 HAW_idea3: "Burgeoning Trade"

 HAW_idea4: "Raiding on Horseback"
 HAW_idea4_desc: "Our military expeditions consist of swift and decisive attacks using mounted warriors, in order to surprise the enemy in the desert before they have a chance of reaching our settlements. Thanks to these raids we have been able to successfully defend ourselves from the many enemies that surround us."
 HAW_idea5: "Desert Homeland"
 HAW_idea5_desc: "When all else fails, our enemy still has to cross the unforgiving desert in order to reach our settlements. Our people have had generations to get used to the harsh conditions of this place, but invading armies are not as familiar with this environment and will surely pay the price for it."
 HAW_idea6: "Links to the Maghreb"

 PDV_idea3: "Communal Independence"
 PDV_idea3_desc: "Starting from the XI century the position of Padua as one of the key cities of the Northeast was secured thanks to a steady territorial expansion, incorporating many small neighboring towns, and allowing the city to defend itself from hostile invaders from Venice, Vicenza and Verona. Among Padua's celebrated victories, the Battle of Castagnaro is noteworthy as a great military victory and one of the most well known battles of the 'Condottieri age'."
 PDV_idea4: "St. Anthony of Padua"
 PDV_idea4_desc: "The Portuguese Saint Anthony, renowed for his powerful preaching, expert knowledge of scripture, and undying love and devotion to the poor and the sick, worked and lived for a long time in Padua, and died there in 1231. His veneration spread widely after his death, becoming the patron saint of Padua and later having many churches built in his name in the Portuguese empire, as well as a great Basilica in Padua itself. Looking at his piety and knowledge of the scriptures as an example will surely increase the resolve of our missionaries."
 PDV_idea5: "The Padoan Renaissance"
 PDV_idea5_desc: "Padua has had a long tradition of supporting artists, and the arrival of famed florentine sculptor Donatello in 1443 triggered a new wave of artistic works in the city, which had already garnered fame thanks to Giotto's work in the XIV century. The Renaissance in Padua led to great development in the entire region as the ideas and techniques later spread to Venice and other cities, and Padua is considered to be along with Florence and Urbino as among the most important early centers of the movement."

Early on it became an important teaching centre for Aristotelism, and later it attracted brilliant inventors and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei. We must make sure to continue this time-honored tradition and keep our nation at the forefront of science and discovery."
 PDV_idea7: "City Expansion"

Surely our theologians could twist the debate in our favour and cripple the heretic cause?"

Before the rich deposits in Istria were aquired, Venice needed the salt that the lands surrounding Ravenna produced. Da Polenta themselves were often allies of Venice, and that led to their downfall - for the last lord Ostasio III had betrayed them and allied the Milanese instead. And even though he joined Venice again later, he was never forgiven, and the century and a half rule of the Polenta came to an end.

This allows us to properly field armies loyal to our cause."

The Walloons in the south have Latin ties, and Flemish in the north being Germanic, with both groups having several dialects and cultural differences. The one thing that unites us, however, is our faith, which we must take advantage of if we want to stabilize our nation."

As well, the cartographer Gerardus Mercator, was Flemish. Mercator also had a very famous Brabantian apprentice in Abraham Ortelius, who went on to create the Victorum Universalis Orbis Terrarum.

 bel_redevelop_brugge_desc: "The city of Brugge was a glorious city with a rich history, having its golden age during the 12th to 15th centuries due to Hanseatic trade, as well as housing the court of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. Issues came in the 16th Century however: The Golden inlet, on which it was situated, started silting, the Hansa declined and the city fell under Habsburg rule, resulting in a drastic decline. As the discovery of the New World has attracted many seafarers to seek their fortune overseas, it necessitates the return of Brugge as a great trade center and, as a major colonial port, in this glorious day and age."

We must seek strong supporters for our independence, lest we end up French, rather than Belgian."

 usa_immigration_vu: "European Immigration"
 usa_immigration_vu_desc: "The United States was a big, relatively empty and still young country. It had the land to lease and the resources to exploit, it just needed the workers.\n\nTired from war, repressive absolutist monarchs and economic regression, Europeans from all over the continent began migrating to the prosperous American republic. Although relatively small in numbers at first, immigration saw a notorious increase in the 19th century, amounting to more than 30 million European migrants between 1836 and 1914."

Another 4 bulls followed that would focus on how to treat, and most importantly, evangelize natives in America.\n\nThese bulls granted Spanish monarchs certain rights regarding the selection and examination of the priests elected to go to the missions. Monarchs would be empowered with a veto right in this regard. The bulls also granted the Spanish crown many other responsabilities and duties that otherwise would be exclusive to the Church, such as organising the churches in American colonies, tithing, decide where and when to build new churches and cathedrals and the ability to present possible candidates for ecclesiastical positions."

 spanish_emigration_vu_desc: "Still not recovered from the previous century's Black Death, ravaged by wars and religious unrest and the economical depression caused by the precious metals shortage during the Great Bullion Famine, European commoners and lesser nobility were in a dire situation.\n\nThe Discovery of America by Columbus at the end of the 15th century and the colonial enterprises started by the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies granted an opportunity to Europeans to leave everything behind and emigrate to the New World with the hopes of a new beginning.\n\nBecause of this and events like the expulsion of Sephardic Jews and Moriscos in 1492 and 1609 respectively, by 1520 over 20.000 Spaniards would have settled just in Santo Domingo alone. Over 2 million Spaniards would emigrate to Argentina between the 16th and 19th centuries, over 500.000 to Colombia, and many more millions would join the transatlantic emigration route."

Under Philip II, Carlos V's successor, Spain, rather than the Habsburg empire, was identified as the most powerful nation in the world, easily eclipsing France and England, retaining its position of dominance with apparent ease despite attacks from Northern European states."
 tercios_vu: "Tercios"
 tercios_vu_desc: "Tercios were military units under the Habsburg monarchs of Spain. Famed for their stamina in battle, Tercios formed the backbone of the Spanish army between the 15th and 17th centuries and were crucial to maintain land hegemony, sometimes even maritime, of the Spanish Empire.\n\nTercios were considered a 'renaissance' of infantry in the battlefield, comparable to Roman legions and Macedonian hoplites. They were the first modern European army due to Tercio units being comprised of professional volunteers, rather than levies or mercenaries, and their pioneer usage of combined arms, being the first to efficiently mix pikes with firearms.\n\nThe emphasis on maintaining a high number of 'viejos soldados' (veterans), together with the particular personality imprinted on them by the proud hidalgos of the lower nobility that nurtured them, made the tercios for more than two centuries the best infantry in Europe."

 gbr_new_model_army_desc: "The New Model Army was the army raised by the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War in the 17th century. Unlike other armies raised for previous conflicts, the New Model Army was intended to be liable for service anywhere in the country, including Ireland and Scotland, rather than being tied to a single area or garrison. Due to the deeply Puritan religious beliefs held by many veterans who formed it, the army's leaders were prohibited from having seats in either the House of Lords or House of Commons.\n\nAs a result of this separation between political and military life, the army's generals became a very professional officer corps and the New Model Army turned into a full-time professional army, the first in the three kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland, proving supreme in the field.\n\nAlthough eventually disbanded by Charles II after the restoration, many of its regiments were integrated into what was now the British Army, with its legacy of a smaller, highly professional army living on to this day."

They constituted major educational and economical centers in England.\n\nHowever, after the Reformation took hold in England, causing internal and external social conflict, monasteries were suddenly dissolved and sold by Henry VIII after a dispute with the Papacy leaving them in a decrepit state, no longer an influential institution. To tackle this monasteries were restored and were used to establish many grammar schools that together with the introduction of the printing press helped England significantly increase its literacy."
 eng_tudor_poor_laws: "Tudor Poor Laws"
 eng_tudor_poor_laws_desc: "Poverty in England was an issue since early 15th century already. A combination of poor crops, black death and heavy economical burden by the Hundred Years Wars led to an economical debacle lasting from around 1440 to the 1480s.\n\nDespite the relatively peaceful era under the Tudor, the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII, which served as providers of social welfare, only worsened the already widespread problem of poverty, which led the Tudor monarchs to enact a series of 'Poor Laws' tackling issues such as street beggars or vagabonds.\n\nHowever these laws had a draconian side where instead of helping the poor through altruism under Christian charity, able-bodied beggars and vagabonds were targeted by punishments if they beg instead of work, some of them so harsh officers of the law often were relunctant to enforce them. At the same time additional Poor Laws were passed requiring parishes to have a store of 'wool, hemp, flax, iron', so that the poor could be set to work, creating a new effective and cheap workforce."

He and his crew set out to the island of Pitcairn, but are swallowed by the same clam. They were able to cut the creature open from the inside using their spears, but found only the remains of Rata's father and uncle. They bring the remains back to Tahiti and bury them. He then went on to become the greatest adventurer-King in our history."

 STY_ideas: "Styrian Ideas"
 STY_ideas_start: "Styrian Traditions"
 STY_ideas_bonus: "Styrian Ambition"
 STY_idea_1: "Reiner Schwur"
 STY_idea_1_desc: "When in 1276 Styrian and Carinthian nobles swore an oath to Emperor Rudolf I von Habsburg at the abbey of Rein close to Graz, the centuries-long reign of the Habsburgs in Styria and the rest of Austria began. If at every coronation all of our nobles pledge their allegiance to our ruler, their support of our reign will be guaranteed, legitimizing our sovereignty."
 STY_idea_2: "Military Frontier"
 STY_idea_2_desc: "The defense of our frontiers is a serious issue, not so much how to do it but how to pay for it. The solution we have hit upon it to make generous land grants on the frontier to build up a professional military class. Not only will this ensure our frontier is adequately defended at a reasonable price but these men will be available for other tasks."
 STY_idea_3: "Rezeß von Wien"
 STY_idea_3_desc: "For a long time, there were exclaves of clerical territories amidst Styria. We have been able to negotiate an agreement with the corresponding rulers. From now on we will be the worldly sovereign being able to tax and raise troops in these regions. However, these territories will still belong to their lordships, and they will still be responsible for all judicial matters."
 STY_idea_4: "Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat"
 STY_idea_4_desc: "Various raids have shown that we need to centralize our defenses in order to react properly. We will found the Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat in which we will convene and counsel with our territorial estates close to the border. This will help to decide with as much information as possible, so that our defensive actions will be more organized."
 STY_idea_5: "Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft"
 STY_idea_5_desc: "For a long time our iron industry was decentralized and was split into many different facilities often taking care of only one production step. Whereas, the foundation of the Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft will lead to the whole production and trade being managed centrally benefiting our iron production."
 STY_idea_6: "Landeszeughaus"
 STY_idea_6_desc: "From now on, our weaponry and military equipment will be stored in the newly built Landeszeughaus of Graz. With its capacity to store equipment for about 16,000 soldiers, it is the biggest armory of the world and will greatly reduce our storage costs."
 STY_idea_7: "Abbey Library Admont"
 STY_idea_7_desc: "A length of 70, a width of 14 and a height of 13 meters make the Abbey Library Admont the biggest monastic library of the world. With its over 200,000 books and with its 48 windows illuminating the library in the spirit of the Enlightenment, the Abbey Library Admont is a wonderful place to dwell and learn about new technologies!"

 TIR_idea_2: "Copper Mining"
 TIR_idea_2_desc: "Tirol was a center of copper mining for centuries. We have important and rich copper mines so mining copper became a tradition in Tirol and we still continue this tradition. So to benefit from copper, we must mine!"
 TIR_idea_3: "Guerilla Tactics"
 TIR_idea_3_desc: "Our territory is composed of the Alps, and we have learned how to fight in these ruthless mountains. If we use this knowledge against our enemies who are invading us by crossing the Alps we can launch a lot of surprise attacks on them."
 TIR_idea_4: "A Divided Austria"
 TIR_idea_4_desc: "We are on a cultural faultline between several Latin, German and Slavic princes who seek to take our valuable resources. Rather than fight them all, it would be best to establish positive diplomacy with them to ensure peace in our time."
 TIR_idea_5: "Neighboring With Italy"
 TIR_idea_5_desc: "Though we are proud of ourselves and want to spread our culture, we are too close to Italy and people from there are migrating to our nation. If we tolerate them we can avoid ruthless rebellions."
 TIR_idea_6: "Condottieri From Italy"
 TIR_idea_6_desc: "Everybody has a talent. And Italians' talent is being mercenaries. They fight war after war for a little money and yet they don't complain a single time. We may as well put them into our service in order to protect our Alps."
 TIR_idea_7: "Harsh Alpine Winter"
 TIR_idea_7_desc: "Winter is an enemy for every nation that is in a war. But winters in the Alps are ten times more severe. It creates too many troubles for the nations who dare to cross the Alps. Because of this, we must use the Alps to create attrition for our enemies."
