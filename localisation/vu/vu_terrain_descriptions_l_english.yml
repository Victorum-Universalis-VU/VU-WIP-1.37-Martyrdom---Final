 urban_paris_desc: "Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. The name Paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period. By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France. The ancient name of the town was Lutetia. Lutetia developed from the middle of the 3rd century BC from the Celtic settlement of Lutetia of the Parisii tribe on the island of the Seine, which is now called île de la Cité. The name Lutetia was first mentioned in writing in 53 BC in the sixth book of De bello Gallico, Julius Caesar's account of the Gallic war. When the Romans approached the city for the second time in 52 BC after an initial failed advance, the Parisii set Lutetia on fire and destroyed the bridges before taking up position. The victorious Romans left them the island and built a new Roman city on the left bank of the Seine in a dominant position on the hill later called Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. Thermae, a forum and an amphitheatre were built there. The city became known in the Roman Empire as Civitas Parisiorum or Parisia, but initially remained quite insignificant in occupied Gaul. In the 4th century, the city's present name became established. In the 5th century, Roman rule was ended by the Merovingians. In 508, Paris became the capital of the Merovingian Empire under Clovis I (466-511). Afterwards, Paris became the capital of a Frankish sub-kingdom under one of his sons. During the Carolingian reign, the Normans repeatedly raided the city. The Capetians made Paris the capital of France. Philip II. Augustus (1165-1223) had the city fortified. In 1190 a wall was built on the right bank of the Seine and in 1210 a rampart on the left bank. At that time, there were many merchants on the right bank of the Seine. At the instigation of Philip II, the Louvre was built on the western edge of the city. In 1181 the first covered market hall was opened and in 1301 a royal palace was built on the île de la Cité. The Sorbonne in the south of Paris developed from several small schools. Charles V (1338-1380) had the wall on the left bank of the Seine renewed to protect the city from the English. In 1370, at his instigation, a wall was also built on the right bank. During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by English forces from 1420 to 1436."

 urban_versailles_desc: "The name of Versailles appears for the first time in a medieval document dated 1038. In the feudal system of medieval France, the lords of Versailles came directly under the king of France, with no intermediary overlords between them and the king; yet they were not very important lords. At the end of the 11th century, the village curled around a medieval castle and the Saint Julien church. Its farming activity and its location on the road from Paris to Dreux and Normandy brought prosperity to the village, culminating at the end of the 13th century, the so-called 'century of Saint Louis', famous for the prosperity of northern France and the building of Gothic cathedrals. The 14th century brought the Black Death and the Hundred Years' War, and with it death and destruction. At the end of the Hundred Years' War in the 15th century, the village started to recover, with a population of only 100 inhabitants."  
 urban_bordeaux_desc: "The city dates back to a Celtic settlement of the 3rd century BC, which was called Burdigala under the Romans and became the capital of the province of Aquitania. In the 5th century Bordeaux was conquered by the Visigoths, shortly afterwards by the Franks. At the latest after the division of the partial kingdom by Charibert I of Paris, i.e. in 567, Bordeaux belonged to Neustria. After the marriage of the Neustrian king Chilperich I, however, he gave the city, together with Cahors, Limoges, Bearn and Bigorre as a morning gift to his bride Gailswintha. These five cities were strategically located to the territory of the father-in-law Athanagild, king of the Visigoths. After Chilperich had arranged for his wife to be murdered, this inheritance passed to the kingdom of Austrasia, following a ruling by a Malberg convened by Guntram, king of the Burgundians. Ultimately disagreeing with this, Chilperich, with his son Clovis as his commander, attempted to reconquer the cities in 573. Although the conquest of Bordeaux was briefly successful, Clovis' troops were driven out again just one month later by the Austrasian margrave Sigulf. In 732, Abd ar-Rahman devastated the city during his campaign. After the defeat of the Arabs at Poitiers, they were pushed back behind the Pyrenees, but in the 9th century the Normans invaded and plundered the city again. Only then did Bordeaux begin to recover. A turning point occurred when Eleanor of Aquitaine made the French southwest an English fief by marrying Henry II. From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux remained under the rule of the kings of England and experienced a second economic flourishing. The city was provided with a new city wall and the Romanesque church was replaced by a Gothic building, the Saint-André Cathedral. Bordeaux was the seat of an archbishop and the capital of the principality of Guyenne, the English adaptation of the French term Aquitaine. "
 urban_orleans_desc: "In Celtic times, Cenabum existed on the site of today's Orléans. It belonged to the territory of the Carnutes and, together with Autricum, was one of the main settlements of this Gaulish tribe. The settlement was conquered by Caesar in 52 BC, who thus also gained control over the port on the Loire. The actual foundation took place during the reign of the Roman Emperor Aurelian; the name Orléans is a phonetic development of the place name Aurelianum at that time. In the 4th century, the ancient city was secured by the construction of a city wall. In fact, in 451, under the leadership of Bishop Aignan and also thanks to the city wall, it was possible to repel an attack by the Huns. In Merovingian times, Orléans briefly became an independent kingdom between 511 and 613, and later the capital of Neustria. The city's importance in the Middle Ages is also attested to by the fact that several kings were elected and crowned here: Charles the Bald (848); Robert II, called the Pious (987) and Louis VI, called the Fat (1108). Later it was an administrative unit within the framework of a county. In 1022, several high scholars, including some canons of the Cathedral of Orléans, were burned to death in the course of the Heresy of Orléans. This was the first known burning of the Christian Middle Ages. In 1344, the lords of Orléans were at least able to regain the title of 'duke'. A few years later, a decree by King Charles VI granted the city an independent administration and financial management. In 1428 and 1429, the city was the last bastion of the French against the English in the Hundred Years' War. On 8 May, it was liberated from the siege under the leadership of Joan of Arc, who was nicknamed the 'Maid of Orleans' in this context."

In the Middle Ages, the characteristics of the coast and the dangers of the open sea forced all maritime traffic between northern and southern Europe to pass by the foot of the cliff and the Abbey of Saint-Mathieu, on which Brest, one of the most important ports of the West, depended at the time. In fact, the Penfeld is an excellent natural harbour. It is sheltered and almost hidden behind a rock of about 200 metres at its longest point, which plunged into the water on two sides and was isolated from the land by a ravine on its third side. Brest is alternately under the rule of the Duke of Brittany and the Kingdom of England. During the War of the Succession of Brittany in 1341, Monfort gave custody of the town to the English. After becoming Duke of Brittany, he tried in vain to drive out the invaders. The King of France also failed.

In 451, the Huns under Attila conquered the city, but withdrew after the battle on the Catalaunian Fields (not far from Reims). Clovis I was baptised in the city's cathedral by Bishop Remigius between 497 and 499, which became decisive for the building of the Frankish Empire. The importance of the city, which soon also became the seat of an archbishop, is also shown by the fact that it was the residence of a partial kingdom during the Merovingian divisions of the empire. In the 8th century, the Frankish king Pippin the Younger met Pope Stephen III in Reims and later Pope Leo III met Charlemagne. The first coronation took place in Reims in 816, when the Frank Louis the Pious, appointed co-emperor by his father Charlemagne while he was still alive, was crowned emperor there once again by Pope Stephen IV after Charlemagne's death. The kings Charlemagne I († 771), Louis IV. († 954) and Lothar († 986) were buried in the Basilica of Saint-Remi. In the 10th century, Archbishop Adalberon was instrumental in ensuring that the French regency passed from the House of the Carolingians to the Capetians. Together with Gerbert of Aurillac, he also ensured that the city, with its cathedral school, became an intellectual centre of the early Middle Ages. From the 12th to the 19th century, Rheims remained the city where the French kings were anointed and crowned; a deliberate continuation of the tradition begun by Clovis. For example, it had great symbolic significance when, during the Hundred Years' War, the French under Joan of Arc succeeded in pushing back the English who had occupied the north of the country and recaptured Rheims, where Charles VII could then be crowned in 1429. City rights have been documented for Reims since 1139. As an important market in Champagne, Reims also had some economic importance."

In 50 BC, the Roman port city of Portus Namnetus was founded on the site of the present-day city of Nantes, named after the Namnetians who lived there. In the third century, the inhabitants converted to Christianity. Around the year 285, the Saxons invaded the region. From the 4th century, Nantes was the seat of a bishopric. In the 5th and 6th centuries, Bretons allegedly arrived from the British Isles. Charlemagne subdued Brittany, but it revolted under his successors. The first fire raid by the Loire Normans is recorded for the year 843. Nominoë, who ruled Brittany at the time, conquered Nantes in 850 and had its walls razed because the city had allied itself with Charles the Bald. In 919 Nantes fell to the Normans, but they were driven out again in 936. Around this time, the rivalry between the Counts of Nantes and the Counts of Rennes began, who fought for supremacy over Brittany. In 1154, Nantes was given to Henry II, who ascended the English throne in that year. In 1203, the county of Nantes came to an end. Peter Mauclerc was made Duke of Brittany in 1213 by the French King Philip II. August as Duke of Brittany and made Nantes his capital. He had Nantes surrounded with fortifications and defended the city against John Ohneland. The city also developed into his important seaport from the 14th century. During the War of the Breton Succession (1341-64), the city initially sided with John of Montfort, but surrendered to Charles of Blois in November 1341. Ultimately, however, the Montforts were victorious, becoming Breton dukes in 1364 and choosing Nantes as their main residence. In 1460, the University was founded in Nantes by Duke Francis II of Brittany and confirmed by Pope Pius II. "

 urban_besancon_desc: "The first mention of the town is in a letter from Louis le Pieux to Archbishop Bernoin in 821; here Besançon was referred to as Chrysopolis. From 843 to 869, the diocese of Besançon was part of the Lotharii Regnum, later of Lotharingia, and after the death of Lothar II, Charles the Bald took possession of it under the terms of the Treaty of Meerssen (870). Until 879 it was thus part of the West Francian Empire. In 888, Odo of Paris feudalised his kingdom and founded the duchies and counties of Burgundy. Burgundy then had Dole as its capital and belonged to the county of Varais, where Besançon was also located. The first Count of Burgundy was Otto-Wilhelm, the Count Palatine. At the same time, Besançon became an independent archbishopric and episcopal see, and it became a tradition that the archbishop also became chancellor to the King of Burgundy. The last King of Burgundy, Rudolf III, had no male successors and gave his possessions to Henry II as a fief. Thus Besançon and the entire county of Burgundy became part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1032. With imperial support, Archbishop Hugo of Salins also became lord of the city, which he led into a period of prosperity. After his death in 1066, however, it falls into a long crisis caused by succession struggles. Throughout the Middle Ages, however, Besançon remained a city directly under imperial rule and independent of the county of Burgundy. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Bisontines resisted the power of the archbishops and finally obtained their urban independence in 1290. Besançon remained part of the German Empire but governed itself with a council of 28 estates and a council of 14 governors. The Free Counts of Burgundy, who had gained dominion over Franche-Comté, became the protecting power for the Free City, which became prosperous during this period."  
 urban_caen_desc: "Caen, first mentioned in a document in 1027, experienced rapid urban development in the 11th century. It was called a burgus (bourg), was the centre of an extensive ducal domain, lay at the crossroads of important roads and had markets as well as a harbour.  He had a strong fortress built in Caen as well as an abbey for women (Abbaye aux dames) and one for men (Abbaye aux hommes) around 1059, where he was also buried. William's tombstone can still be seen in the church today. The English King William II and his brother, Duke Robert II of Normandy, concluded a treaty in Caen in 1091 in which they settled their disputes. If the Norman conquest of England (1066) had already promoted the further development of Caen, it benefited equally from the burning of the rival city of Bayeux in 1105. Caen developed into a centre of intellectual life - for example, the theologian Thibaud of Étampes († after 1120) studied here - and became one of the main residences of King Henry I († 1135), then the administrative centre of Normandy in the late 12th century. The French King Philip II. August was able to take possession of Caen without resistance in May 1204 and confirmed the liberties granted to the city by John Ohneland on 17 June 1203. However, it lost some of its previous status as a political and intellectual centre.  Louis IX stayed here in 1256 and 1269. Caen now had an important textile industry, whose products such as sheets and linen fabrics were exported mainly to Italy. Trade contacts with England, on the other hand, declined. In the early stages of the Hundred Years' War, the city was conquered and plundered by King Edward III of England on 26 July 1346, before he moved on with his army and fought the Battle of Crécy, which was victorious for him. On 8 October 1346, Caen received permission from King Philip VI of France to build strong city walls. King Henry V of England conquered Caen in September 1417, and most of the inhabitants preferred not to emigrate. During the reign of the Duke of Bedford, the University of Caen was founded in January 1432 and began official teaching in 1436. "

In 154 BC, the Romans established themselves in the area after the Greek settlements of Nikaia and Antipolis, had been attacked by Ligurians from the area of Biot and Cannes. To secure the region, the Romans then built a second settlement, Cemenelum, next to Nikaia on the mountains of Cimiez. The place was thus a regional administrative centre and experienced a boom, especially due to the construction of the Via Julia Augusta (7 BC), so that the base grew into a town around this time. In the fifth century, Cemenelum was abandoned in favour of Nikaia. Provence fell to the Ostrogoths in 508, and to the Frankish Empire in 536. In 813, 859 and 880, Nice was sacked by Saracen attackers who came from the sea. In 1144 a city council ('consulate') is mentioned, in 1176 a first city constitution. However, Nice remained subject to the County of Provence, so that the city was Aragonese in the 12th century and belonged to the House of Anjou from 1246. In the 13th century, competition with Genoa became increasingly noticeable, which even briefly gained suzerainty over the city around 1215. In response, the Count of Provence had a fleet stationed in Nice around 1250. In 1295, the town of Villefranche was founded near Nice with a base to combat piracy. In 1385, after the death of the sovereign Joan I, succession turmoil ensued when Charles of Anjou and his cousin Charles of Durazzo claimed the county of Provence for themselves. In this situation, Nice turned against the Anjous at the instigation of Lord Jean Grimaldi, whereupon in 1388 Duke Amadeus VII of Savoy annexed the eastern part of Provence to his dukedom as Terre Neuve de Provence and later as the County of Nice (French - Comte de Nice), which thus gained access to the sea. Because of its strategic location, the town was heavily fortified and was subsequently always fought over. "

From 418 at the earliest, Poitiers took on important political and economic tasks in the Tolosan Empire of the Visigoths. Not far from the city, the Visigoths were defeated by the Franks in the Battle of Vouillé in 507. The Frankish Merovingians and Carolingians ordered the construction of numerous churches within the Gallo-Roman walls, as well as at the Old Market and on the banks of the Boivre. In 558, Radegundis of Thuringia founded the monastery of Sainte-Marie-hors-les-Murs near the city with the support of Chlothar. In the Battle of Tours and Poitiers (732), the Frankish ruler Charles Martell stopped the further advance of the Moors into Central Europe. In the 8th century, Poitiers became the centre of the county of Poitou. With the transfer of the ducal title of Aquitaine to the Counts of Poitou at the end of the 10th century, Poitiers rose to become the capital of the entire south-western French region between the Loire and the Pyrenees. Under the reign of Eleanor of Aquitaine, Poitiers experienced a cultural and economic flourishing, but her marriage to Henry II Plantagenet also saw the beginning of conflict with England. In 1356, the French King John the Good was captured in Poitiers after the Battle of Maupertuis between England and France. In 1369, the city was reconquered by France. Because Paris was under English occupation during this period, Charles VII's government was transferred to Poitiers from 1423 to 1436.

It is assumed that at this time the missionary Benignus of Dijon, who had worked in this city for a long time, suffered martyrdom. In 500, the Franks under Clovis I defeated the Burgundians under Gundobad in the Battle of Dijon. Later, Dijon came under the rule of the bishopric of Langres, from which the Counts of Dijon held it in fief, and after the death of the last of these (1007) to the Dukes of Burgundy, who made it their residence. In 1016, the city came into the possession of King Robert II the Pious, who incorporated it into the Duchy of Burgundy. Three church assemblies (Concilia Divonensia) were held in Dijon, in 1077, 1116 and 1199. On 28 June 1137, a conflagration destroyed the city, which was rebuilt under Duke Hugo II. Duke Hugo III elevated Dijon to the status of a city in 1187 and the suburb of Saint-Bénigne was enclosed and incorporated with a city wall. The Charité hospital was also founded at this time. After Philip I of Burgundy died in 1361, the King of France gave the Duchy of Burgundy with Dijon as its capital to his son, Philip the Bold, in 1363.

Century. These documents mention the importance that the castle and the small town surrounding it already had for Béarn life. By the 12th century, the castle had been extended and a few houses had been added, all forming a small hamlet. The lords of Béarn then granted this new village, which continued to expand slowly. In 1188, Gaston VI of Béarn meets his court major there to renovate the general fortress in front of all the barons of Béarn. In the 13th century, Pau becomes a castel - a sign of the importance and expansion of the city. Gaston Fébus affirmed the independence of Béarn in 1347 and remained very attached to the independence of his small country during his reign. He began important works to strengthen the strongholds of Béarn, including the castle of Pau, where he occasionally resided. From 1370 to 1378, he had a masonry keep added, as well as an outer fortified enclosure with the mint tower.

Following Roman rule, it belonged successively to the Visigoths, Basques, Franks and Normans. The Dukes of Gascony, who drove out the Normans towards the end of the 10th century, gave the town many privileges. The inhabitants gradually settled outside the city walls. After the futile attack of the King of Aragon, Alfonso I the Quarrelsome, in 1130, the then owner of the city, Duke William X of Aquitaine, gave Bayonne a new enclosure on both banks of the Nive. In documents, the Roman name Lapurdum was now replaced by the Basque name Baya one. The English obtained Bayonne in 1152 when the Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry (II). They raised the liberties and prosperity of the city, which was granted municipal rights by King John Ohneland in 1215. The inhabitants sent a total of 30 galleys to the English in 1224 to support La Rochelle against Louis VIII of France.

During the 13th century, the town had about 1,000 inhabitants. In 1244, the annual contribution of 200 livres was abolished and replaced by a 'civic tax': All inhabitants were obliged to pay an amount between 2 and 6 sols, depending on their income. In 1327, the Seigniory of Bourbonnais was established as a duchy by the French King Charles IV Le Bel. Louis I Le Grand, the first Duke of Bourbon, resided little in Moulins, as did his son and successor Pierre I. It was only with Louis II Le Bon that Moulins actually became the capital of the duchy and, as the residence of the dukes, the de facto capital of the territories they administered.

The second syllable mond probably comes from the term 'monte' for an elevation. What is meant is a castle hill, an old fortification called a motte - Roermond therefore means 'Rurburg'. According to another interpretation, 'mond' is derived from the Latin mundium - city, i.e. 'city on the Rur' or 'Rur bridge' with the Celtic-Germanic 'monde' for 'bridge'. The urban origins go back to the Romans. An altar stone dedicated to the goddess Rura found in the town area dates back to the 3rd century A.D.

The oldest surviving document mentioning Roermond dates from 1130; at that time it belonged to the Duchy of Guelders. In 1213, Roermond was destroyed by the German Emperor Otto IV.

Traces of human settlement go back to the Stone Age, with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of megaliths, dolmens and standing stones (Plattesteen near the Grand-Place/Grote Markt and Tomberg in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, for example). During late antiquity, the region was home to Roman occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered on the current site of Tour & Taxis, north-west of the Pentagon (Brussels' city centre). Following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, it was incorporated into the Frankish Empire. Lambert I of Leuven, Count of Leuven, gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the banks of the Senne, on an important trade route between Bruges and Ghent, and Cologne, Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (Treurenberg, Coudenberg and Sablon/Zavel areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on what is now the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula (1225), replacing an older Romanesque church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became Dukes of Brabant. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire.

After the division of the Frankish Empire, which began in 843, and further, mostly warlike divisions of the Middle Kingdom, Antwerp became part of the Eastern Frankish Empire, the early medieval forerunner of the Holy Roman Empire. The Ottonians founded the Margraviate of Antwerp, which was part of the Duchy of Lower Lorraine. In the 11th century, the most famous leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon, was originally Margrave of Antwerp from 1076 until his death in 1100, but later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten founded a community of his Premonstratensian canons at the Abbey of St Michael in Caloes. At the beginning of the 12th century it came to the Counts of Louvain (the later Dukes of Brabant). The place was granted city rights in 1291.  Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.

In the Bruges area, the first fortifications were built after Julius Caesar's conquest of the Menapii in the first century BC, to protect the coastal area against pirates. The Franks took over the whole region from the Gallo-Romans around the fourth century and administered it as the Pagus Flandrensis. The Viking incursions of the ninth century prompted Count Baldwin I of Flanders to reinforce the Roman fortifications; trade soon resumed with England and Scandinavia. Early medieval habitation starts in the ninth and tenth centuries on the Burgh terrain, probably with a fortified settlement and church. Bruges had a strategic location at the crossroads of the northern Hanseatic League trade, who had a kontor in the city, and the southern trade routes. Bruges was already included in the circuit of the Flemish and French cloth fairs at the beginning of the 13th century, but when the old system of fairs broke down, the entrepreneurs of Bruges innovated. They developed, or borrowed from Italy, new forms of merchant capitalism, whereby several merchants would share the risks and profits and pool their knowledge of markets. They employed new forms of economic exchange, including bills of exchange (i.e. promissory notes) and letters of credit. The city eagerly welcomed foreign traders, most notably the Portuguese traders selling pepper and other spices."

The inhabitants thus regrouped around this place and around the Graslei on the Leie. Probably at the end of the 10th century, a first city wall was built and Ghent expanded.

Already in the 13th century, the city had 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants and more and more houses were built of stone. The fortifications were enlarged, the gates reinforced. Ghent was always a rebellious city striving for autonomy. For centuries, the citizens fought against their respective lords to preserve or increase their privileges or freedoms. The nobility had to cede much of their power to the merchant families. Until 1302, a number of wealthy burgher families, the so-called XXXIX (39 Ghent aldermen), effectively ruled, as politics and jurisdiction were in their hands. They sought to protect their interests, so they often sided with the French king and against their direct lord, the Count of Flanders. During the first phase of the Hundred Years' War, Ghent, after initial neutrality, eventually opted for the English side because the city was dependent on the import of raw materials for textile production and the English had blocked imports. Jacob van Artevelde, a wealthy cloth merchant, led an uprising against Louis II of Nevers because he sided with the French king. Subsequently, there were repeated uprisings until the Peace of Doornik was concluded in 1385. In 1384, Ghent became part of the Duchy of Burgundy because Duke Philip the Bold had married the heiress Margaret of Flanders. The handling of privileges did not change as a result, there was even an amnesty for any form of rebellion, but Ghent had to give up its alliance with England and recognise the King of France. However, when Burgundy restricted the power of the guilds, there was another uprising. The fighting was fierce, but eventually the merchants of Ghent had to admit defeat to the Burgundians. In 1407, the Council of Flanders was established in the city, using Dutch as the language of business."

 urban_namur_desc: "The town began as an important trading settlement in Celtic times, following east-west and north-south trade routes through the Ardennes. The Romans settled after Julius Caesar defeated the local Aduatuci tribe. Namur became famous in the early Middle Ages when the Merovingians built a castle or citadel on the rocky outcrop above the town at the confluence of the two rivers. In the 10th century it became an independent county. The town developed somewhat unevenly, as the Counts of Namur could only build on the north bank of the Meuse - the south bank belonged to the bishops of Liège and developed more slowly into the town of Jambes. In 1256, Henry V of Luxembourg conquered the county of Namur in the absence of Baudouin II of Courtenay, who was occupied in Constantinople. After the rights of the county had been ceded to Gui de Dampierre, Count of Flanders, it was he who began the struggle against Luxembourg and regained the county by marrying Henri's daughter. In 1262 Namur fell into the hands of the Count of Flanders and was bought by Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1421."

The site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times, and there are archaeological remains of the Celtic Carpetani settlement, Roman villas, a Visigoth basilica near the church of Santa Maria de la Almudena and three Visigoth necropoleis near Casa de Campo, Tetuan and Vicalvaro. The first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the Muslim age. In the second half of the 9th century, Umayyad Emir Muhammad I built a fortress on a headland near the river Manzanares as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between Al-Andalus and the kingdoms of Leon and Castile, with the objective of protecting Toledo from the Christian invasions and also as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the Taifa of Toledo. n the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by Alfonso VI of Leon and Castile, who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo, in turn conquered in 1085."

Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis. Known as Ishbiliyah after the Islamic conquest in 711, Seville became the centre of the independent Taifa of Seville following the collapse of the Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 11th century; later it was ruled by Almoravids and Almohads until being incorporated to the Crown of Castile in 1248."

 urban_jaen_desc: "In times of Roman rule over the Iberian Peninsula, silver was mined in the area around Jaén. After the end of the Caliphate of Córdoba, Jaén became the capital of a small Taifa emirate for a short time in 1145, when first Ibn Yuzai rose to become autocrat there and was ousted just a few months later by Abu Dja'far Ahmad Zafadola, who had also seized power in Córdoba and Granada in the same year. Also in the same year, however, Jaén was conquered by the Almohads and incorporated into their great empire. In 1159, Mohammed ibn Sa'd ibn Mardanisch, the 'Wolf King' (Rey Lobo) of Murcia, succeeded in driving the Almohads out of Jaén once again and annexing it to his own domain until 1168. Then it fell for a few months to the Hamuskid Ibrahim, who had also secured Arjona, but had to give way to the Almohads again in the same year 1168. When the Almohad empire broke up, Jaén was first conquered by the Nazarite Muhammad I ibn Nasr (1232-1272) from Arjona, but fell into the hands of the Castilians as early as 1246 in the course of the Christian Reconquista. Due to its regained strategic importance, the city once again assumed the role of head of the new Castilian kingdom, and until the conquest of Granada it played a very important role in the struggle against the Muslims of the south. In this way, King Enrique II of Castile granted it many privileges, such as its own council and town hall. It became one of the 18 cities that had representation in the courts and enjoyed his royal privileges. Throughout this period, the importance of the Jewish population should be highlighted, especially from the 10th century and during the reigns of Fernando III the Saint and Alfonso X until the severe persecutions against the Jews in 1391."

 urban_burgos_desc: "In Roman times, the area was located on the road connecting Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and Burdigala (Bordeaux). In the 7th/8th century, the area around Burgos was reconquered from the hands of the Moors by the kings of Asturias. A castle was built in 884 by the Castilian Count Diego Rodríguez Porcelos on the orders of King Alfonso III of Asturias as an important fortification in the fight against the Moors. In 931, Fernán González, the first Count of Castile independent of the Kingdom of León, named Burgos the capital of his dominion. Burgos rose to become the coronation city of the kings of Castile in the 11th century, which underlines its special importance. The city's immediate neighbourhood was also the birthplace of the most famous Spanish hero of the Middle Ages, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, who is buried with his wife Jimena in Burgos Cathedral, which was only built later. After the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI (1085), Burgos lost some of its importance, but it remained an important economic, cultural and political centre in northern Spain. Some Spanish cities were founded from Burgos, such as Bilbao, a foundation confirmed by King Fernando IV of Castile on 4 January 1301. Burgos was an important stopover for pilgrims on the French Way, the most popular route to Santiago de Compostela, and a commercial centre between the Bay of Biscay and the south, attracting an unusually large foreign merchant population that became part of the urban oligarchy and excluded other foreigners. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the kings of León and Castile and a favoured burial place. In the 14th century, official royal interference in the city's affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans on whom the tax burden fell. The alguacil was the royal official appointed to adjudicate disagreements. On 9 June 1345, Alfonso XI swept aside the municipal government and established direct royal rule over Burgos through the regimiento of sixteen appointed men. "

In many of the maps and documents from the 13th century onwards, Santander is referred to as San Andrés, San André, Sant Ander and Sant Andero.  In 1248, Santander took part in the battle to conquer Seville, along with other Cantabrian towns, and as a reward received a coat of arms with representations of the Torre del Oro and the river Guadalquivir. King Alfonso X designated the city as Sant Ander in 1255, when he granted his brother the right to appoint mayors and jurors. By order of the king, shipyards were built to exploit the forests of the Cantabrian woods for the construction of ships. The city was obliged to provide the monarchy with one ship per year. On 4 May 1296, the Cantabrian coastal towns formed the Brotherhood of the Cities of the Navy of Castile with Vitoria or Brotherhood of the Marshes. Their aim was to strengthen their commercial position against the competition from the other side of the Bay of Biscay, especially in the trade of wool and flour with the cities of Flanders and England. In 1296 and 1311, the town of Sant Emeterio was destroyed by two fires. King Ferdinand IV of Castile exempted the town from 'the tithe of all food that came from outside my kingdom' because of the disaster. In the 14th century, the Book of the Merinities of Castile (known as the Calf of the Behetrias) confirms this condition, that of the Behetry, for the city, i.e. it defines it as dependent only on the monarchy, without any other feudal lord except the prerogatives of the abbot. Tensions between the Old and New Towns, led by the Giles and Negretes clans, forced the monarchy to regulate the governance of the town in the 15th century, placing two mayors (one for each town) and several aldermen.

During this period, the city followed the destiny of Al-Andalus and, after the dismemberment of the Caliphate of Cordoba, belonged to the taifas of Denia, Almeria and Murcia. The Treaty of Cazola between Alfonso VIII of Castile and Alfonso II of Aragon made Alicante part of the Castilian expansion territory. Through the Treaty of Almizra, signed in 1244 between the kings of Castile and Aragon, which established the limits of the expansion of their respective dominions on the line from Biar to Villajoyosa, Alicante remained under Castilian sovereignty for 48 years. Given the city's military and commercial importance, Alfonso X the Wise attempted to settle a large group of Christians in Alicante from the beginning, but the process of repopulation was slow. The Christian repopulators, mainly Castilians and Leonese, were granted all kinds of privileges and concessions to facilitate their settlement. With this aim of better securing its growing population and more actively promoting its greater economic and commercial advancement, Alfonso X granted the city the Fuero Real (Royal Charter), very similar to that of Cordoba, in August 1252. Alicante became a city on 22 April 1296, which ended Castilian sovereignty. Christian repopulation continued, with Catalans and, to a lesser extent, Aragonese. Nevertheless, until the first expulsion of the Moors, the Arab population was in the majority compared to the Christians. From 1333, various wars and the Black Death (1348) ensured a Castilian takeover and a population reduction by half. Peter IV dictated numerous measures to revive the economy and social peace. During the 15th century, Alicante continued to grow and a flourishing export-oriented agriculture (wine, nuts, esparto) fostered a remarkable development of the port and a middle class that controlled the city government."

The Phoenician colonists recognised the favourable location of the island at the mouth of the Guadalete, near Tartessos, which is rich in silver, and halfway to the 'Tin Islands' (Britain). Under the Phoenicians, Gadir became a flourishing trading centre. From the 7th century BC onwards, there were Western Phoenician workshops from which objects of Oriental tradition came. With the expansion of Carthaginian rule in the west, Cadiz became part of their empire and developed into the most important trading centre of Carthaginian Atlantic traffic from around 500 BC. After the fall of Carthage, the city came under Roman rule and was given the Latinised name of Gades. From then on, Cadiz became increasingly important and prosperous. In 49 BC it provided valuable support to Caesar in his civil war against Pompey. Caesar granted Cádiz Roman citizenship. It became a municipium, was named Augusta Urbs Iulia Gaditana under Augustus and developed into one of the richest and largest cities in the west of the Roman Empire during the imperial period. With the fall of the Roman Empire, Cadiz also lost importance. It was destroyed by the Visigoths in the 5th century and taken by Arab conquerors in 711, who rebuilt it under the name Djesirat Kadis. Vikings devastated it in 844. On 14 September 1262, the Castilian king Alfonso X conquered Cadiz and drove out the Moors. He then settled Christians living in his northern parts of the empire in the city, for which a revival now began."

A Celtiberian settlement, it was re-founded as a city around 35 BC by the Roman proconsul Gaius Norbanus Flaccus under the name Colonia Norbensis Caesarina. In the 6th century, large parts of the city were destroyed by the invading Visigoths and only later rebuilt by the Moors. In 1139, the King of León, Ferdinand II. (León), succeeded in conquering the city. In 1165, the city was taken by Geraldo the Fearless, a Portuguese adventurer who created an independent principality in Extremadura, but was dispossessed by force. As the kingdom was unable to organise its defence, the city was handed over to the newly founded Order of Santiago. As early as 1179, the city had to be abandoned again and it was not until 1229 that Alfonso IX finally succeeded in capturing the city for the Kingdom of León. The reconquered city was granted privileges by Alfonso IX and Cáceres was fashioned as a royal city, directly dependent on the Leonese crown and with no local government other than its own council. By this charter, the Crown reserved for itself a considerable portion of land between those of the Order of Santiago and those of the Order of Alcántara. The prohibition of state property contained in this fuero prevented the formation of a strong nobility, so the city was ruled by a mesocracy of agricultural knights. In the 15th century, the city suffered from the internal disputes of the nobility. The Catholic Monarchs issued several decrees and regulations to try to pacify the local nobility."

If the town played only a minor role in Al-Andalus, it was nevertheless the most important north of the Tagus, with up to 5,000 inhabitants. Due to Sa dun as Surunbaqi's treachery, the Moors lost Coimbra again in 878, and the Banu Danis settling in Coimbra and the rest of the Muslim population were expelled. In 987, the city was destroyed during the renewed Moorish conquest by the commander Almansor. Coimbra was not reconquered until 1064 by King Fernando de Castilla y León. Moors conquered the city for the last time in 1117, but finally evacuated it after a few days. Coimbra was Portugal's second capital - shortly after Guimarães when the independent Kingdom of Portugal was founded in 1139. After Lisbon became the capital, the city's position in the country declined, but it remains important today, especially as a university city. Founded in 1290 by King Dom Dinis, the University of Coimbra is the oldest university in Portugal and one of the oldest in Europe.

###Italy###

 urban_roma_desc: "Rome, also known as the 'Eternal City' is a major city of Italy with a history spanning 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. Rome is also called 'Caput Mundi' (Capital of the World). In the year 300, Rome reached its greatest population of an estimated 1.2 million inhabitants. The city soon lost political importance, however, as the various emperors preferred other residences. After the end of the Western Roman Empire, it was not until the reign of Pippin that Rome regained its importance as the capital of the Papal States and as the most important place of pilgrimage for Christianity alongside Jerusalem and Santiago de Compostela. New splendour came to the city in 800, when Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III. At that time, the population was just 20,000. Due to the rapid decline in population, a good three quarters of the city area enclosed by the Aurelian Wall became deserted and lay fallow, becoming overgrown and later used for agriculture. The ancient city centres, the Roman Forum, the Capitol, the imperial fora, the Colosseum etc. all lay in the uninhabited disabitato."  
 urban_parma_desc: "The history of the city dates back to the Etruscans. The Roman consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus founded the city of Colonia Iulia Augusta Parmensis on the right bank of the river Parma in 184 BC with the status of a Roman colony. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled by various powers over the next centuries - the Ostrogoths, Lombards, Frankish Palatines. Under Frankish rule, Parma became the capital of a county in 774. Like most northern Italian cities, it was nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire created by Charlemagne, but was ruled locally by its bishops, the first being Guibodus. In the subsequent battles between the papacy and the empire, Parma was usually a member of the imperial party. Two of its bishops became antipopes - Càdalo, the founder of the cathedral, as Honorius II, and Guibert as Clement III. Around 1140, an almost independent municipality was established; a treaty between Parma and Piacenza in 1149 is the earliest document of a municipality governed by consuls. After the Peace of Constance in 1183 confirmed the Italian municipalities' right to self-government, long-standing disputes with the neighbouring municipalities of Reggio Emilia, Piacenza and Cremona intensified with the aim of controlling the vital trade line across the Po. The struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines was also present in Parma. In 1213, their podestà was the Guelph Rambertino Buvalelli. After a long struggle alongside the emperors, the papist families of the city won control in 1248. In 1247-48 the city was besieged by Emperor Frederick II, but was crushed in the ensuing battle. Parma fell under the control of Milan in 1341. After a brief period of independence under the Terzi family (1404-1409), the Sforza asserted their rule (from 1440) through their associated Pallavicino, Rossi, Sanvitale and Da Correggio families."

 urban_firenze_desc: "Florence was established after 59 BC by Julius Caesar as a colonia named Florentia (after the Roman goddess of flowers and plant growth) in the fertile but still partly marshy Arno valley. The colonia consisted firstly of a military camp, the castrum. The favourable location at the crossroads of the Via Cassia leading to Rome, the Etruscan road (Volterana) coming from Volterra and the likewise Etruscan Pisana, which led to the sea via Pisa, favoured the rapid flourishing of the city on the basis of trade and crafts. The older Etruscan settlements, especially the important Fiesole, situated on a hill to the north of the new city, quickly fell behind as a result. After the Etruscan cities of Volterra and Chiusi as well as the Roman coloniae of Pistoia and Lucca had been outranked alongside Fiesole, Emperor Diocletian named Florence the capital of the Seventh Region (Tuscany and Umbria). In the course of the Byzantine wars of reconquest, the city was almost completely destroyed and only revived under the Lombards. However, since the Lombard dukes resided in Lucca and Pisa, Florence was unable to regain its importance before the Migration Period until the 12th century. The transfer of the official residence of Margrave Hugo, who was appointed by the Carolingians, to Florence around 1000 was decisive for the city's revival. With the rise of feudalism, the city expanded in the 12th century and finally became autonomous. The burghers gained power and there were bitter quarrels between the Ghibellines, who were loyal to the emperor, and the later victorious supporters of the pope, the Guelfs. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the city flourished and set the standard for European art and culture. Many artists and scholars settled here, including Donatello, Botticelli; later Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei. The cultural-historical epoch of the Renaissance developed. " 
 urban_pisa_desc: "Pisa was founded as an Etruscan port in the middle 6th century BC. The Etruscans called the city 'Pise' and boosted the city's economy through art and ship production. The city was strategically ideally located, being on the Arno River and at the same time so close to the sea. Pisa's power also grew because of its expansion to the banks of the Arno. The port attracted merchants from all over the Mediterranean and during the 11th and 12th centuries Pisa became a maritime republic. From then on, Pisa became a successful conqueror and prevented Islamic expansion, reaching the Sicilian coast, North Africa and Sardinia. The first Archbishop of Pisa, Daiberto, was in command of Pisa's fleet during the First Crusade and became Patriarch of Jerusalem. Thanks to the strength of the fleet, Pisa founded colonies in the Middle East. Pisa also founded colonies in northern Africa and in various Byzantine centres, such as Constantinople. In the 12th century, Pisa was militarily and economically the most important city, overtaking even Venice. From the middle of the 12th century, Pisa expanded inland into Tuscany - to the south towards Piombino and Valdarno. The 14th century is rich in internal and external tensions. The period of the Republic was very important in terms of cultural and scientific discoveries. In 1324 Pisa lost Sardinia, ruled by the Crown of Aragon, and the entire 13th century was marked by terrible repressions against Lucca and Florence. In 1406 Pisa was conquered by the Florentines. After the Florentine conquest, Pisa went through a period of severe regression and political instability."

However, the city only gained its real importance in the Middle Ages. Like other Italian cities, it gradually became independent and had a consular government in the 12th century. In the dispute between the emperor and the papacy, Siena - unlike Florence - was on the Ghibelline side and thus received various privileges. Essentially, however, this conflict concealed an economic rivalry between the two trading cities. The Florentines were defeated in the Battle of Montaperti in 1260. The following years, however, brought a decline for the Ghibellines. Within the city there were repeated political power struggles, but these did not prevent the city from flourishing economically. The Sienese formed an alliance with Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1389, accepted his supremacy ten years later and gave up the liberties of their state. The Great Western Schism, which stirred up the Christian world, again brought unrest to Siena. As a consequence of the decisions of the Council of Pisa, Florence and Siena had declared themselves against Gregory XII (1409). As a supporter of the Pope, Ladislaus of Naples therefore took the opportunity to carry out raids on Siena's territory, laying it waste and threatening the city. The Sienese resisted fiercely until the death of this monarch in 1414 freed them from the attacks. Another war with Florence broke out in 1431, caused by the Florentine efforts over Lucca and continued as a result of the Florentine alliance with Venice and Pope Eugene IV and the Sienese alliance with the Duke of Milan and the Roman King Sigismund. The latter monarch stopped in Siena on the way to Rome for his coronation and received a most princely reception. In 1433 the opposing alliances signed a peace treaty, and although it was disadvantageous to the Sienese and they were often tempted to break it, they faithfully adhered to its terms. "

In the run-up to the investiture dispute at Pentecost 1064, a synod was held at this location that resolved the papal schism of the time, which caused the division between the German court and the Roman reform papacy, and confirmed Pope Alexander II as the rightful pontiff against the counter-pope Honorius II.

After 984 it was a fief of Tedalda, Count of Modena and Canossa, a nephew of the Roman-German Emperor Otto I. Ferrara then became independent and was taken by Margravine Matilda in 1101 after a siege. At this time the city was dominated by a small group of important families, including the Adelardi. In 1146 Guglielmo, the last of the Adelardi, died. His property passed to Azzolino d'Este, as did the dowry of his niece Marchesella. Ferrara took part in the Battle of Legnano in 1176 against the Roman-German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa with its own contingent of troops. There was enmity between the newly added family and the Sailinguerra, but after extensive fighting Azzo Novello was appointed permanent Podestà in 1242. In 1259 he captured Ezzelino da Romano of Verona in a battle. His grandson Obizzo II succeeded him and the Pope appointed him Captain General and defender of the Papal States. From then on, the House of Este was nestled in Ferrara. The Po, which had flowed directly past Ferrara in the 12th century, cut a new path north of the city in 1155, making the old riverbed increasingly shallow. In 1391, the University of Ferrara was founded. Niccolò III received several popes with great pomp, especially Eugene IV, who held a council here in 1438. "

 urban_napoli_desc: "In 1194, the Hohenstaufen, who had seized all of southern Italy in a short campaign, replaced the previous rulers, the Normans, under Henry VI. They deprived Naples of its privileges. Hohenstaufen rule in Naples did not last long after Frederick's death in 1250. The French House of Anjou established a new rule when Charles I of Anjou conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and held it as a fief of the Pope from 1266. After bitter disputes with the Hohenstaufen heirs, Charles I was able to defeat the Hohenstaufen in 1266 and 1268. Under the Angevins, Naples regained considerable importance when they made it the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily. From 1270 onwards, new city walls, new urban areas and a port near the markets to the east were built, as well as numerous churches. The Angevins also built the fortresses Castello del Carmine and Castel Sant'Elmo and, from 1279, the Castel Nuovo, which served both as a defence for the port and as a royal residence. By 1300, Naples already had 50,000 inhabitants. The court's need for luxury stimulated trade, which was dominated above all by Florentines, but also by Genoese, Venetians, Catalans and Marseilles. Even though their rule, which lasted until 1442, was marked by brutal domestic repression, they ensured that the city flourished economically and culturally and took fundamental urban planning measures to modernise it. In 1442, Spaniards, namely the Crown of Aragon under Alfonso, defeated the last ruler of the French Angevins, destroying large parts of the city and the fortified belt already incorporated by suburbs."  
 urban_ajaccio_desc: "In the 6th century BC, Carthaginian settlers first arrived on the island, followed by Greek settlers who founded a settlement called Alalia around 565 BC. In Greek times, the island was called Kyrnos. The dominant naval powers of the time, Carthage and the Etruscans, together defeated the Greeks in the naval battle of Alalia (around 540 BC). Thereafter, Alalia was dominated by the Etruscans until the 3rd century BC. After Carthage briefly regained dominance, Alalia was conquered by the Romans in 259 BC in the First Punic War. With the founding of the colony of Sardinia et Corsica in 227 BC, Corsica became part of the Roman Empire for around 650 years. Still in the final phase of the Western Roman Empire, battles between Vandals and Goths began over the island in the 5th century AD, from which the Vandal king Geiseric emerged victorious. After the conquest of Italy by the Eastern Roman Empire, Corsica became part of the Byzantine Exarchate of Carthage in 536. In the following centuries, the island was disputed under changing regional powers - Byzantines, Lombards, Saracens, Franks, the Margraves of Tuscia and the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa, but only ever succeeded in establishing themselves in the coastal regions. Above all, the raids by Saracen pirates led to a large part of the population retreating into the interior and the island became increasingly impoverished. Over time, a feudal system developed. In addition, the Catholic Church also gained political authority at that time. From the 14th century, Corsica belonged to the Republic of Genoa, which built a fortification in Bastia. The name Bastia is derived from the Italian name bastiglia. "
 urban_ravenna_desc: "In the early and high imperial period, Ravenna was a lagoon city surrounded by water, with at times up to 50,000 inhabitants. In 88 BC the city was granted Roman citizenship. In 402, the Western Roman Emperor Honorius moved his court from Milan to Ravenna, as the city was very defensible. Although some later emperors resided temporarily in Rome, Ravenna remained the clearly preferred seat of government in Italy from then on. The Ostrogoths under Theoderic, who had resided in Ravenna since 493, established an empire in Italy that lasted until their final defeat by Eastern Rome (552). They ruled nominally as deputies of the emperor in Constantinople. Under them, the capital Ravenna once again experienced a period of cultural and economic prosperity until around 535. In 751, the Lombard king Aistulf conquered the city and exarchate, thus ending the exarchate of Ravenna. In the Treaty of Quierzy (754), Pippin the Younger promised to hand over the former Byzantine exarchate of Ravenna to the Holy See; in return, Pope Stephen II legitimised the Carolingians as the new royal dynasty of the Frankish Empire. Until his death, Pippin led two successful campaigns against the Lombards and gave the conquered territories to the Roman See, which Charlemagne confirmed in 774. In 967, Emperor Otto I held an imperial diet in Ravenna. Later, Ravenna led the confederation of cities that grew into an autonomous republic, including Ancona, Fano, Pesaro, Senigallia and Rimini, and was already the seat of an important school of law in the 11th century. In 1275 the city came under the rule of the da Polenta family, and in 1441 it passed into the hands of Venice."

After several centuries of Roman rule, Milan was declared the capital of the Western Roman Empire by Emperor Diocletian in 286. In 313, the so-called Edict of Toleration of Milan (Milan Convention) was proclaimed here, in which the emperors Constantine and Licinius assured Christians freedom of worship. In 402 the city was besieged by the Visigoths (after which the imperial residence was moved to Ravenna), and 50 years later (452) the Huns captured the city. In 539, the Ostrogoths conquered and destroyed Milan in the course of the so-called Gothic War against Emperor Justinian. Milan then fell to the Lombards in 569 until it became part of the Frankish Empire in 774. During the war of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa against the Lombard cities, Milan was largely destroyed in 1162. In the Lombard League of Cities, founded in 1167, Milan took the leading role. After the independence granted to the Lombard cities in the Peace of Constance in 1183, Milan developed into a Signoria, first under the della Torre, then from 1277 under the Visconti. In 1395, Gian Galeazzo Visconti became the first Duke of Milan."
 urban_venezia_desc: "Veniceia is a city in northeastern Italy. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions of the city are linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce—especially silk, grain, and spice."  
 urban_torino_desc: "The name of the city derives from tau, a Celtic word meaning 'mountains'. Folk etymologically, the Italian name Torino can be translated as 'little bull', which is why a bull is depicted on the city's coat of arms. The area was settled in pre-Roman times by the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of the Taurines. One of these settlements was destroyed in 218 BC by Hannibal during his march towards the Alps. In the first century B.C. (probably in 28 B.C.), the Romans built a military camp here (Castra Taurinorum), which was later dedicated to the Emperor Augustus (Augusta Taurinorum). The typical Roman city structure with streets running at right angles to each other has survived to the present day. The Quartiere Romano is the oldest part of the city. In Roman times, Turin had about 5,000 inhabitants, all of whom lived within the high city walls. In 312, the Battle of Turin took place, in which the troops of Emperor Constantine the Great defeated those of his adversary Maxentius. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was conquered first by the Lombards, then by the Franks, and was ruled by bishops. At the end of the 13th century, the Dukes of Savoy took the city. The gardens and palaces were built in the 15th century, when the city was rebuilt from scratch. In 1404 the university was founded."

Together with Alba, it was the main Angevine possession in Northern Italy; Angevine rule interrupted by periods under the control of Saluzzo, Savoy, and the Visconti of Milan was ended in 1382 when Cuneo was acquired by the Duchy of Savoy."

It was only as a colony of the Emperor Augustus that Verona became a large city. Decius defeated the emperor Philippus Arabs here in 249, Constantine Pompeianus in 312. Stilicho succeeded in defeating Alaric here in 402. Attila plundered and devastated the city in 452. Then, along with Pavia and Ravenna, it was the residence of the Ostrogothic king Theoderich, who defeated Odoacer here in 489 and is called Dietrich von Bern in the legend. The old name of the town dates from this time - 'Dietrichsbern'. The name 'Welsch-Bern' (Cimbrian - Bearn) was also used in ancient times. In the 5th and 6th centuries, Verona was not only the residence of the Ostrogoths, but also of the Longobard king Alboin, until it came under the Frankish Empire. In the wake of the devastating Hungarian invasions of Upper Italy from 899 onwards, the heavily fortified city became the seat of a mint after 900, which became the starting point of the Veronese currency area. From 952 Verona belonged to the Margraviate of Verona and thus to the Duchy of Bavaria and (from 976) to Carinthia. It was not until the beginning of the 12th century that Verona became independent and had its own city rights. The Council of Verona took place in 1184. In the struggle against Emperor Frederick I, Verona was one of the leaders of the Lombard League of Cities. It was then shaken by the party fights of the noble parties, the Montecchi (Ghibellines) and the San Bonifazios (Guelphs). At the beginning of the 13th century, the Ezzelini, the protectors of the Montecchi, seized the city. After the death of Ezzelino da Romano (1259), the people of Verona elected Mastino I della Scala as head (Podestà) in 1260, whose family ruled for 127 years and reached its highest power and prosperity under Cangrande I della Scala. In 1387 Verona came under Milan's rule, and in 1405 under Venice's."

In 663, Emperor Constans II led an army to recapture the territory occupied by the Lombards from Benevento also to Taranto, but in the end the attack on Benevento failed. Afterwards, Taranto and its surrounding countryside came into Lombard possession. The city was first conquered in 839 by Saracens led by one Saba, whose fleet defeated that of the Venetians commissioned by Constantinople to drive out the Muslims. Three years later, there is evidence of the presence of an 'Apolaffar' who may have come from the Muslim colony of Crete. The Saracens, i.e. Islamised Arabs and Berbers, established an emirate from 846 to 880. However, this was conquered between 846 and 847 and again between 851 and 852. In 880, the Byzantine commander Leon Apostyppes reconquered the city for Constantinople. Within a decade, a kind of provincial administration emerged, a theme. Nevertheless, the city remained endangered. On 15 August 927, for example, it was sacked and destroyed by Saracens led by the Slav Sabir. It was not until 967 that it was rebuilt by the strategist Nikephoros Hexakionides. The Normans did not succeed in conquering the city until the second half of the 11th century, although Byzantium under Georgios Maniakes still attempted to reconquer Sicily from 1037 to 1043, which succeeded in the eastern part. The territorial foundations of the principality of Taranto were probably laid in 1086. The city still had a strong Greek influence and a flourishing Jewish community. Frederick II bequeathed the principality to his son Manfred. Under the Angevins, the principality was first confiscated, but then bequeathed to Philip, the son of Charles II of Anjou. A class arose within the city that obtained a number of concessions and privileges from the lords. In 1399, Raimondello del Balzo-Orsini obtained the principality. After his death, the principality passed in turn to Maria through her marriage to Ladislaus of Anjou-Durazzo. Aragon finally put an end to this concentration of power. "  
 urban_bari_desc: "Bari was already inhabited during the Middle Bronze Age. Later Bari was a city of the Peuketians in Apulia. Greeks settled in the city, which they called Barion. As part of the Roman Empire, it was given the name Barium. As early as 180 BC it appears as an important port, had a strong fishing industry and had the status of a municipium since 89 BC. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476), Bari first came to the Goths, then to the Byzantine Empire. In 690 Romuald of Benevento seized the city from the Byzantines, who regained Bari in 720. In 755 it was taken by Pippin the Younger, and in 802 it fell to the Duke of Benevento. In 847, a Saracen fleet conquered the city and founded an Islamic emirate there in Italy. In 871, Bari was retaken by the Byzantine Empire, which established the centre of its Italian territories there. The Byzantines successfully defended the city against further Saracen attacks in 988 and 998. Although Bari was then conquered again by Arabs in 1002, it was quickly recaptured by the Byzantine army. On 15 April 1071, after a three-year siege, the Normans under Robert Guiskard conquered the city, the last possession of Byzantium in Italy at that time.In 1096, a large part of the Crusader army embarked in the port of Bari for the First Crusade. In 1155, the inhabitants of the city rebelled against the Normans and negotiated with the Byzantines. In retaliation, in June of the following year, William I 'the Wicked' had the city destroyed except for the cathedral and the Basilica of St. Nicola and expelled the inhabitants. It was not until 1166 that William II authorised reconstruction. After the death of Henry VI in 1197, Bari came under papal rule for some time. Bari experienced a period of prosperity under Frederick II. He came to the city for the first time in 1221. On his return from his crusade after 1229, the gates of the city were locked, so he had to gain access by force. Therefore, he probably had the fort built in 1233 to keep the city at bay. On the other hand, he granted the city generous trade privileges and left it the leading role in the region. Bari was hard hit by the preferential treatment of foreign merchants and bankers under the Angevins. Robert of Anjou gave Bari as a principality to his favourite Amelio del Balzo. In the 15th century it came to the Sforza as a duchy."

This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean world. Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of Sicily, next to the Gulf of Syracuse beside the Ionian Sea. It is situated in a drastic rise of land with 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) depths being close to the city offshore although the city itself is generally not so hilly in comparison.

Coin of Sextus Pompeius with the lighthouse of Messina and the sea monster Scylla, which supposedly defeated Octavian. In the early 5th century BC, Anaxilas, the tyrant of Rhegion, renamed the city Messene in honour of his home town of Messene in the Peloponnese. Messina was sacked and burned by the Carthaginians in 396 BC, then reconquered by Dionysius I of Syracuse. In 288 BC Messina was conquered by Campanian mercenaries, the so-called Mamertines, who killed all the men and divided their women, children and property among themselves. When Hieron II of Syracuse took action against the continuing threat in 265 BC, the Mamertines called on Carthage and Rome in turn for help, thus providing the impetus for the intervention of the two rising powers in Sicily, which subsequently led to their clash in the Punic Wars. At the end of the First Punic War, Messina was a free city allied with Rome. Soon after, it became part of the province of Sicily. In Roman times, the city was given an important lighthouse. From 42 to 36 BC, Messana, as the Romans called it, was the most important base of Sextus Pompeius during his naval war against Octavian. Until the 9th century, the city experienced economic prosperity as an important trading centre. In 843 the city was conquered by the Arabs, in 1061 by the Normans. In 1232, the city was the centre of an unsuccessful revolt against Emperor Frederick II. After the rule of the Hohenstaufen and Angevins, Messina became the capital of the Regno di Sicilia under the rule of Aragon."
 urban_palermo_desc: "The Phoenicians founded the city as a trading base in the 8th century B.C. During the First Punic War from 264 to 241 B.C., Palermo was an important Carthaginian stronghold until it was conquered by the Romans through a naval blockade in 254 B.C. and given the name Panormus. Under Augustus, former Roman legionaries settled there and Panormus developed into one of the most important cities in the province of Sicilia. After the Vandals founded their empire in North Africa in 429 with today's Tunisia as its centre, they invaded Sicily several times and conquered the city. Palermo lost importance and finally fell to Ostrom in 535. In 831 Palermo became the capital of the emirs of Sicily and developed into a flourishing economic centre through the cultivation of orange and citrus trees. The port was expanded and new districts were built. The population at the time is estimated at around 100,000 to 120,000. According to Ibn al-Athir, the Muslim Emir Muhammad b. Abdallah b. Aghlab, who ruled Sicily from Palermo from 832 to 851, used the city as a base for incessant looting. Since ancient times, Sicily was the granary of the world at that time and the most coveted agricultural land of the Middle Ages. This made it a bone of contention among political powers. In 1072, the Normans under Roger I conquered Palermo. At the beginning of the 12th century it became the capital of the county, and from 1130 of the kingdom of Sicily. The cultural heyday under the Normans continued when the Staufers took power in 1194. Frederick II expanded the city into a glamorous residence and founded the Sicilian School of Poetry. After the execution of the last Hohenstaufen, Conradin, Sicily came under the rule of Charles of Anjou, who moved the capital of his empire to Naples. Palermo became increasingly dilapidated and the poverty of the population led to the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. This revolt ended Charles' rule in Sicily.  The revolt led to the division of the Kingdom of Sicily into an insular and a continental Sicily. Palermo initially remained the capital of the insular kingdom until 1412, when it fell to the Crown of Aragon and Palermo became the seat only of the viceroys of Sicily. "
 urban_valletta_desc: "The origins of Mdina's settlement date back to the Bronze Age, when the hill served as a place of residence because of its strategic location.

The Romans surrounded the city together with neighbouring Rabat with a strong fortress wall. In this era, the city was inhabited by almost 1,000 people. After the Arabs conquered the Maltese archipelago in 870, they gave the city its present name Mdina = city. In order to be able to defend it better, they reduced the fortification belt to the urban area of Mdina. The city walls were strengthened again during the Norman rule in the 12th century. Conveniently situated and fortified in this way, Mdina withstood an attack by 18,000 Hafsids in 1422 and was subsequently given the honorary title of 'Città Notabile'."

However, early settlements have been found dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence in the area and not the presence of a town that early). During the Middle Ages, Zurich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy. Unlike most other large Swiss cities, Zurich rose to the rank of a city in the early Middle Ages. In Turicum there was already a customs post and a fort in Roman times, but the associated settlement cannot yet be called a town. Early medieval Alemannic Zurich was closely connected with the Duchy of Swabia and two important ecclesiastical foundations of the German kings, the Grossmünster and the Fraumünster, which were dedicated to the cult of the city patrons Felix and Regula. After the collapse of central power in the Duchy of Swabia and the extinction of the Zähringers in 1218, Zurich was able to secure the status of imperial immediacy; in 1262, the imperial freedom of the citizenry was also expressly confirmed. The title of imperial city meant de facto independence for the city. Internally, the fate of Zurich was jointly managed by the city nobility and the craftsmen's associations (guilds) since the guild revolution by Mayor Rudolf Brun in 1336 (Brun's guild constitution). Brun was also responsible for the raid on Rapperswil. In 1351, to secure its independence against the rising southern German noble dynasty of the Habsburgs, Zurich joined the Swiss Confederation and became a suburb of this confederation together with Bern."

First documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Kopenick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. Colln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.

In any case, medieval Schleswig took over Haithabu's legacy as a centre of northern European trade - together with the western harbour at Hollingstedt, which had already existed since the Viking Age: here the land route between the Baltic and the North Sea was particularly short. In the 13th century, however, Schleswig had to cede its role as a supra-regional trading metropolis of the north to Lübeck, but at that time it was still a trading centre of regional importance.

The document, written in Latin, states ... actum super fluvium Moin in loco nuncupante Franconofurd - given (issued) on the river Main in a place called Frankfurt. However, there is evidence of settlement on the Domhügel as early as the Neolithic period. Subsequently, a Roman military camp and, in Merovingian times, a Frankish royal court were probably established on the same site. In 843, Frankfurt became the most important royal palace of the East Franks for a time and the site of imperial congresses. In 1220 Emperor Frederick II abolished the office of imperial bailiff in Frankfurt. This ministerial office was replaced by the Reichsschultheiss, appointed by the emperor as head of the burghers. In the course of the 13th and 14th centuries, the city gained more and more privileges and regalia, for example the annual autumn fair in 1240 and the spring fair in 1330. In 1266, the town council consisting of 42 patricians and master craftsmen was mentioned for the first time. Since 1311, two mayors were elected annually by the council as self-governing heads of the town. With the acquisition of the Schultheißenamt, Frankfurt achieved full sovereignty as an imperial city in 1372. The Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed Frankfurt as the rightful electoral city of the Roman kings, after most royal elections had already taken place here since 1147. The other princes around envied the increasing prosperity of the city on the Main and involved it in numerous feuds. In 1389, the imperial city suffered the greatest military defeat in its history in the Kronberg feud against the Kronberg knights and their allies. The city had previously decided to fight in the city war on the side of the Rhenish League of Cities against Ruprecht of the Palatinate, but 40 to 100 of the more than 2,000 armed men and numerous unarmed fell in the decisive battle on 14 May 1389. Another 600 prisoners had to be ransomed with 73,000 guilders. From then on, the city shifted to an effective alliance policy, involving its former opponents in a system of mutual dependencies and obligations with money and through treaties. The imperial city maintained its armed neutrality until the end of medieval feuding through Emperor Maximilian I's perpetual land peace."

Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively-large town in the 13th century and received town privileges in 1241 because of its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains and so east–west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, and their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia. In the 14th century, the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates."

 urban_bremen_desc: "Bremen is the capital of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen. Bremen is a major cultural and economic hub of Northern Germany. For most of its 1,200 year history, Bremen was an independent city within the imperial jurisdiction of Germany's Holy Roman Empire. Its governing merchants and guilds were at the centre of the Hanseatic League that sought to monopolise the North Sea and Baltic Sea trade.Between the 1st and 8th centuries AD, the first settlements were built on the Weser, which offered protection from floods on a long dune and at the same time good access to a ford. As a bishop's town and merchant settlement, Bremen's history goes back to the 8th century. However, it was initially still an uncertain mission territory. In 787, Willehad of Bremen became the first bishop of Bremen. In 848, the Archbishopric of Hamburg merged with the Bishopric of Bremen to form the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, with its seat in Bremen, and in the following centuries the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were the driving force behind the Christianisation of northern Germany. United with the Archbishopric of Hamburg to form the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen from the late 9th century, Bremen first gained influence at the imperial level under Archbishop Adalbert (1043-1072). With Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa's Gelnhausen Privilege of 1186, Bremen became an imperial city. In 1260 the city joined the Hanseatic League, but was at times an uncertain ally in the Hanseatic League. In 1350 the population reached 20,000. Around this time the Hanseatic cog (Kogge) became a unique product of Bremen. In 1386, the city of Bremen became feudal lord of the noble families of Altluneburg and Elmlohe, who had previously been vassals of the Knights of Bederkesa. In 1404, the city replaced the old wooden Roland statue, which had been destroyed by the Bederkesa in 1366, with a larger model made of limestone. Bremen flourished as a result of the free trade associated with membership of the Hanseatic League, to which splendid architectural monuments bear witness. The city, which was gaining economic importance, partially shook off the ecclesiastical rule of the Bishopric of Bremen and erected the Roland (1404) and its town hall (1409) on Bremen's market square as a sign of its secular freedom."

In the Late Middle Ages, Magdeburg was one of the largest and most prosperous German cities and a notable member of the Hanseatic League. In 1207 a catastrophe struck the city, with a fire burning down large parts of the city, including the Ottonian cathedral.

The name of the city makes reference to the Franks, and means Ford of the Franks, and there appears a Gallic rooster in the coat of arms of the city. The official name Frankfurt (Oder) and the older Frankfurt an der Oder are used to distinguish it from the larger city of Frankfurt am Main. The city's recorded history began in the 13th century as a West Slavic settlement. During its history, it was successively part of the Kingdom of Poland and then the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The town of Frankfurt received its charter in 1253 at the Brandendamm. The early settlers lived on the western banks of the Oder; later the town was extended to the eastern bank. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the town came under the control of the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1319, Wartislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania, granted new privileges to the town. The town fell again to Brandenburg in 1324. In the Late Middle Ages, the town dominated the river trade between Breslau and Setttin. From 1373 to 1415, along with Brandenburg, it was part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown."  
 urban_koblenz_desc: "The Romans built a fortified urban settlement here for the first time. The Confluentes fort was built in today's old town centre to secure the Roman Rhine Valley Road (Mainz-Cologne-Xanten) and the Niederberg fort was built in Niederberg to secure the Limes and the first bridges over the Rhine and Moselle. Koblenz is thus one of the oldest cities in Germany. After the Roman troops withdrew in the 5th century, Koblenz was conquered by the Franks, who founded a royal court here. In 842, negotiations between Charlemagne's three grandsons took place in the Kastor Church, which was consecrated in 836 and ultimately led to the division of the Frankish Empire in the Treaty of Verdun in 843. In the following reign of the archbishops and electors of Trier, Koblenz continued to flourish and a multitude of cultural treasures in the form of churches, castles and fortifications were created. The Ehrenbreitstein fortress gradually developed from the castle built on Ehrenbreitstein around 1020. In uncertain times, the greatest sanctuaries were kept in this most secure castle of the Electorate. Between 1242 and 1259, Archbishop Arnold II of Isenburg built Burg Stolzenfels as a Kurtrian customs castle opposite the Kurmainz castle of Lahneck, and in 1253 acquired the bailiwick of Koblenz. The town was now entirely in the possession of the archbishops of Trier. Isenburg began to extend and reinforce the city wall around 1250. The administration of Koblenz was under the control of the Schultheiß, who in turn was appointed by the archbishop. However, the Koblenz town council, first mentioned in 1272, was opposed to the archbishop. Thus, from 1277 onwards, Heinrich II von Finstingen had the Old Castle built as a stronghold against the citizens who were striving for more independence. The burghers prevented the further construction of the city wall and castle from 1281 onwards. Heinrich II of Finstingen was thus forced to subjugate the town and launched an armed counterattack in 1283. Archbishop Diether of Nassau finally subdued the town in 1304 after fierce fighting. Construction of the Balduin Bridge began under Elector Balduin of Luxembourg around 1342 and was completed in 85 years."  
 urban_potsdam_desc: "Potsdam is a large city within Brandenburg. Potsdam sits on the River Havel, a tributary of the Elbe, downstream of Berlin, and lies embedded in a hilly morainic landscape dotted with many lakes, around 20 of which are located within Potsdam's city limits. It lies some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre. The name of the city and of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.In the course of the migration of peoples from the 4th century onwards, the Suebi, the Elbe-Germanic sub-tribe of the Semnones, left their homeland along the Havel and Spree rivers in the direction of the Upper Rhine, with the exception of a few remnant groups. In the 6th and 7th centuries, Slavs moved into the area, which was presumably largely empty of settlements. During this period, the Slavic tribe of the Hevellers built a castle on the Havel opposite the confluence of the Nuthe. The first documented mention of the village was in a deed of donation by Emperor Otto III of the Holy Roman Empire as Poztupimi on 3 July 993. The donation was to be made to his aunt, Abbess Mathilde of Quedlinburg. The document probably remained ineffective for the time being, since due to the Slavic uprising of 983, German rule had been pushed back to the Elbe. The document mentions the two places Poztupimi et Geliti, which today are interpreted as Potsdam and Geltow. The importance of the region was based on the control of the Havel crossing. Nevertheless, the town was remote from the important trade routes and surrounded by water and marshes. The inhabitants subsisted mainly on agriculture, cattle breeding and fishing. The Holy Roman Empire continued its eastern colonisation more decisively in the following years. It was not until 1150 that Albrecht the Bear finally succeeded in conquering Potsdam. He founded the Mark Brandenburg in 1157 and thus became the first Margrave of Brandenburg. Through Albrecht, the Nordmark, as the Mark Brandenburg, also de facto became part of the Holy Roman Empire. A German, stone tower castle was built at the Havel crossing, about 700 m from the Slavic castle. A small service settlement developed next to the castles. The original Slavic castle probably continued to exist. In 1304, Potsdam was mentioned for the first time as 'Stedeken' (little town). In 1317, it was first mentioned in a document as a castle and, more importantly, as a 'town' under the name Potsdam. In 1345 Potsdam received its town charter and for a long time remained an insignificant small urban market town. From 1416 onwards, Potsdam remained in the possession of the Hohenzollern dynasty."  
 urban_worms_desc: "Worms is a city situated on the Upper Rhine about 60 km (40 mi) south-southwest of Frankfurt am Main. A pre-Roman foundation, Worms is one of the oldest cities in northern Europe. Since Augustan times (31 B.C. to 14 A.D.), Worms and its surrounding area belonged to the Roman dominion. A Roman military base existed from the beginning of the 1st century AD until around 85 AD. The associated civilian settlement with the Celtic name Borbetomagus became the capital of the Civitas Vangionum and developed urban structures. In Frankish times, the secure Worms bishop list begins with Bishop Berchtulf, who took part in the Paris Synod in 614. The early bishops Amandus of Worms († 7th century) and Rupert of Salzburg († 718) are among the saints of the Roman Catholic Church. Amandus became the patron saint of the bishopric and the city of Worms. Under the Carolingians, Worms formed one of the centres of power, so that its bishops were close to the royal court in the 8th and 9th centuries. In 829 and 926, imperial days of the Frankish and East Frankish empires respectively were held in Worms. At this time Worms, which in the 9th century had still been one of the Carolingian centres of power, had already moved to a peripheral position due to the Frankish division of the empire. At the Court Day in Worms in May 961, Otto the Great had his seven-year-old son Otto II raised to the rank of co-king. In 976 Otto received from Worms the newly created Duchy of Carinthia in fief, which had previously been part of Bavaria. The Salians marked the beginning of the city's rise to its greatest splendour. In 1074 it gained freedom from customs duties. In 1076, another court day was held here, at which King Henry IV declared Pope Gregory VII deposed and was immediately banned from the church for this - one of the consequences of these events was then going to Canossa. In 1122, the Worms Concordat, named after the city, was concluded in Worms. After the fall of the Salians in 1125, the Staufers also became closely associated with the city. In 1184, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa granted the city extensive rights of freedom, which can be regarded as the foundation of the imperial city. The 12th century was then marked by the beginning of a dispute between the bishop and the town council over the de facto rule of the town, which was to continue for a long time."

The island with the historic old town and the districts north of the Trave are also located in the historical region of Wagria. The name 'Lubeck' ultimately stems from the Slavic root lub- ('love'). Before 819, Polabian Slavs founded a settlement which they called Liubice on the mouth of the Schwartau into the Trave. Since the 10th century, Liubice was the second-most important settlement of the Obotrites after Starigard. Lubeck was granted Soest city rights in 1160, and, in 1260, it became an immediate city within the Holy Roman Empire. In the middle of the 12th century, Lubeck developed into the cradle of the Hanseatic League, of which it was considered the de facto capital and most important city from then on. The Lubeck law was eventually adopted by around 100 cities in the Baltic region. Lubeck could preserve its status as an independent city, which it held since 1260."

Aachen developed from a Roman settlement and thermae (bath complex), subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of Emperor Charlemagne of the Frankish Empire, and, from 936, the place where over 30 Holy Roman Emperors were crowned Kings of the Germans. Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under Hadrian, around 124 AD. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century AD that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at Buchel, adding at the end of the same century the Munstertherme spa, two water pipelines, and a probable sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area, along with extensive bathhouses near Burtscheid. After Roman times, Pepin the Short had a castle residence built in the town, due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the Rhineland and northern France. In the year of his coronation as king of the Franks, 768, Charlemagne came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time. As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It was also the site of many important church councils, including the Council of 837 and the Council of 1166, a council convened by the antipope Paschal III."

 urban_emden_desc: "The history of Emden begins around the year 800, when a Frisian trading settlement was founded at the mouth of the Ems. The first documentary evidence of seafaring in Emden dates from 1224, when an Emden merchant ship is mentioned in London. Until that time it was only a small settlement built on a mound. Through various lords, the county was purchased by the bishops of Münster in 1252, who were confronted with constant disputes with the Frisians. These finally led to a treaty in which questions of ecclesiastical law and trade were settled. After the treaty, the power of the Münster bishops was limited to the settlement of Emden, while in parallel the regional community continued to grow stronger. In the period that followed, the bishops no longer exercised their rights in the city themselves, but resorted to the local Abdena family, whom they made their representatives in the city. The first known representative of the Abdena, Wiard Droste tho Emetha, had a castle built in the town for the first time around 1300, and customs rights also fell to the Abdena in 1362 at the latest. From this time onwards, there is also the first evidence of the town's far-reaching trade relations, according to which Emden ships and merchants visited the markets of Lübeck, Hamburg, Haren, Friesoythe and Harderwijk, and were supported by Hisko with an escort letter from 1390 onwards. The strengthening of East Frisian chieftain families led to a long-lasting period of feuds of mutual alliances. Two parties were established, the Freedom League of the Seven East Frisians under the leadership of the later count and prince family Cirksena and the party of Focko Ukena. Imel was also a member of the latter, who called the Vitalien brothers to Emden to secure his position. In 1433, the up-and-coming Cirksena independently allied themselves with the city of Hamburg. The latter wanted to put an end to the East Frisian toleration of the pirates once and for all and therefore relied on a strong sovereign in East Frisia. With the help of the Hanseatic League, the Cirksena conquered the city and castle of Emden in 1433, where a Hanseatic garrison was established. The Hamburgers had the town fortified more strongly. The city, which had long been cut off from its surrounding countryside by the conflicts between the chieftains, was able to flourish again economically during this period, as trade with the Hanseatic League was open to it. In 1439 this garrison left again and the town was handed over in good faith to the Cirksena."  
 urban_augsburg_desc: "Augsburg is considered to have been founded in 15 BC, as a legionary camp, which later also served as a supply depot, was established in this year. Emperor Augustus had commissioned his two stepsons Drusus and Tiberius to do this. According to this foundation date, Augsburg would be the second oldest city in Germany after Trier. In the first century, the settlement of Augusta Vindelicum formed around the camp that had been established before the turn of the century, and Emperor Hadrian granted it Roman city rights in 121 AD. From around 95 AD, Augsburg was the capital of the Roman province of Raetia, which extended to Upper Italy. In 260 AD, the Germanic Juthungen invaded Italy and Raetia and carried off thousands of Italians. On their march back, however, they were defeated and put to flight by the Roman governor in a two-day battle. After the division of the Roman province of Raetia in 294, Augsburg became the capital of the province of Raetia Secunda, which was invaded by the Alamanni after the end of Roman rule around 450, but the settlement continued. Augsburg was affected by fighting between Bavarians and Franks in Charlemagne's time. On 21 June 1156, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa restored Augsburg's city charter. The culmination of these developments was imperial immediacy, which was granted by King Rudolf of Habsburg on 9 March 1276 with the privilege of its own charter. The town charter was summarised in the town book of 1276. Augsburg's now extended independence led to fierce disputes with the high diocese as the prince-bishop's secular domain, which culminated in the relocation of the bishop's main residence to Dillingen on the Danube. Augsburg's development into an imperial city was completed in 1316, when Ludwig the Bavarian guaranteed the city's inalienability from the empire. Subsequently, more and more patrician families took over the rule of the city, but this did not always go smoothly: for example, in 1368 there was an uprising of the city's craftsmen, which led to the introduction of a guild constitution. Eleven years later Augsburg joined the Swabian League of Cities, which disintegrated again in 1388. As a result of the guild constitution and the associated regulation of all craft activities, the power of the guilds grew steadily and they were also involved in the city government."

Slavic tribes migrated to the area around 600, followed by Emona's decline. Around 800, the area of Ljubljana fell under the rule of the Franks. In the Eastern Frankish and later Holy Roman Empire, the area around Ljubljana belonged to the Margraviate of Carniola. The period between 1112 and 1125 is the time of the first written records of Ljubljana. The first documentary mention of the city dates back to 1144.

In 1278, after the defeat of King Ottokar II by Rudolf of Habsburg, Ljubljana became the property of the Habsburgs.

Ulm was an important palatinate location for the next 50 years, which was reflected in the numerous royal visits. During the Hungarian storms, the palatinate was probably converted into a refuge. Ulm lost its importance as a place of royal visits during the time of the Saxon kings in the 10th and 11th centuries. It was not until the Salians that there is evidence of more royal sojourns. In 1079, Friedrich von Staufen was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Swabia. After consolidating their power in this region, the Staufers were able to develop Ulm into one of their main bases. The extinction of the Salians led to fights over the imperial estates from this inheritance, as a result of which Ulm was burnt down in 1134. Under the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the Ulm Palatinate was rebuilt from 1140 and in its wake the settlement was further expanded. In 1181 it was raised to the status of a city and in 1184 became a Free Imperial City. Around 100 years later, Ulm seems to have been completely fortified, as it withstood a siege by the counter-king Heinrich Raspe in the winter of 1246. Ulm developed into one of the centres of power of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperors. With the end of Hohenstaufen rule, Ulm managed to remain a royal city. The expansion was accompanied by the refortification of the city. Within the city, the first half of the 14th century was marked by civil war-like unrest, which was connected with disputes between the guilds and the urban patriciate. In 1345, an interim solution was found in the form of the Kleiner Schwörbrief, which temporarily pacified the situation by granting the guilds a decisive say in political and legal matters for the first time. Under Ulm's leadership, the Swabian League of Cities was founded in 1376 as an alliance of 14 Swabian imperial cities. On 30 June 1377, the construction of Ulm Cathedral began. After its defeat in the First Town War in 1388, the Swabian League of Towns fell apart. As a result, Ulm lost influence on the other Swabian towns, but remained as influential both economically and politically. In 1396, Geislingen with Helfenstein Castle, Altenstadt, Amstetten, Aufhausen and other places came to the city when the Count of Helfenstein had to settle his debts to the city.

Historians date this event at about 1158. The layout of Munich city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of Hoxter. Henry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home somewhat upstream at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich.

With the extinction of their male line around 1189, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1193. From the late 12th century to the Interregnum, however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German Reichsschultheiss) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city. The city and particularly Nuremberg Castle would become one of the most frequent sites of the Imperial Diet (after Regensburg and Frankfurt), the Diets of Nuremberg from 1211, after the first Nuremberg diet elected Frederick II as emperor."

 urban_kiel_desc: "Since the subjugation of the Saxons by Charlemagne, the area around the Kiel Fjord belonged first to the Frankish Empire and then to Holstein. Kiel was founded between 1233 and 1242 by Adolf IV, who had only shortly before regained rule over the county, which had been temporarily lost to Denmark. Presumably there had already been a merchant settlement on this site for some time before 1233. However, it was only at Kiel that the Frankish-Saxon territory abutted the Baltic Sea - to the north of the Levensau lay Schleswig and thus Danish territory, to the east of the Schwentine behind the Limes Saxoniae lay Wagrien and thus Slavic territory, which at that time was not yet firmly in the hands of the Holstein counts. Therefore, this spot on the fjord was the only possibility for a Saxon or Holstein Baltic port. As such, Kiel was planned as one of the northernmost cities in the Holy Roman Empire. In 1242 Kiel was granted the Lübische Stadtrecht (town charter). In the Middle Ages, Kiel's long-distance trade lagged far behind that of other Baltic ports such as Lübeck, Flensburg, Stralsund, Rostock and Wismar. Although the city joined the Hanseatic League in 1283/1284, it rarely took part in joint activities and was hardly able to make use of its trading privileges: The sovereign's influence on trade was stronger here than in the free cities.  Economically more important for the city than membership in the Hanseatic League was the Kiel transshipment. For one week (from 6 to 14 January), money transactions were conducted here, especially by the nobility and merchants. Interested parties travelled from all over the country for this. In 1301 Kiel was already fortified. The sovereigns, the Schauenburg Counts of Holstein and Stormarn, had built a castle. From 1329 the city was surrounded by a stone city wall. At this time Kiel had nine city gates: Holsten Gate (Holstein Gate), Küter Gate (Küter=inner butcher), Hass Gate, Danish Gate, Calico Gate, Fisher Gate, Flemish Gate, Schumacher Gate and Pfaff Gate. Besides the Franciscan monastery, there was only one church, the Nikolai Church, which was completed around 1240."  
 urban_stettin_desc: "Stettin is an important port and city in the region of Pomerania. Stettin is located on the river Oder, south of the Stettin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania. The city is situated along the southwestern shore of Dabie Lake, on both sides of the Oder and on several large islands between the western and eastern branches of the river. During the Wendish Crusade in 1147, a contingent led by the German margrave Albert the Bear, an enemy of Slavic presence in the region, papal legate, bishop Anselm of Havelberg and Konrad of Meissen besieged the town. There, a Polish contingent supplied by Mieszko III the Old joined the crusaders. However, the citizens had placed crosses around the fortifications, indicating they already had been Christianised. Duke Ratibor I of Pomerania, negotiated the disbanding of the crusading forces. After the Battle of Verchen in 1164, Szczecin duke Boguslaw I, Duke of Pomerania became a vassal of the Duchy of Saxony's Henry the Lion. In 1173, Szczecin castellan Wartislaw II, could not resist a Danish attack and became vassal of Denmark. In 1181, Boguslaw became a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire.With the rise to power of the dukes from the Griffin dynasty in the second third of the 12th century, Pomerania had developed more and more into an independent state entity, whose politics reached a first peak under Barnim I from 1226 to 1278. Barnim I went down in history as a founder of towns and also granted the Wendish settlement of Kessin together with the German suburbs as 'oppidum Stetin' the town charter in 1243, a Stettin variant of the Magdeburg town charter. Under Barnim I, it was further promoted through customs remission, trade privileges and fishing rights, so that the city also grew stronger economically. In addition, the high court for all cities with Magdeburg-Stettin city rights was established in Stettin. In 1245, the duke allowed the construction of a town hall. The construction of a harbour gave the city a further economic boost, which led to membership of the Hanseatic League in 1278. The division of Pomerania in 1295 with the establishment of the Duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast, which cut Szczecin off from the coast, initially brought economic disadvantages, which became apparent, among other things, in the dwindling influence in the Hanseatic League. In 1309, Duke Otto I began building a castle and thus officially made Szczecin the residential city of Pomerania. On 15 July 1345, the city acquired the minting rights from the duke and was thus able to further expand its outstanding position in Pomerania. At the end of the 14th century, Szczecin's economy received a further boost, as both Poland and Pomerania granted the city extensive trading privileges in order to be able to replace Gdansk, which was dominated by the Order, as a trading metropolis."  
 urban_breslau_desc: "Breslau is one of the largest cities in the region of Silesia. It lies on the banks of the River Oder in the Silesian Lowlands of Central Europe, roughly 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the Sudeten Mountains to the south. In the 13th century, Wroclaw was the political centre of the divided Polish kingdom. In April 1241, during the First Mongol invasion of Poland, the city was abandoned by its inhabitants and burnt down for strategic reasons. During the battles with the Mongols Wroclaw Castle was successfully defended by Henry II the Pious. After the Mongol invasion the town was partly populated by German settlers who, in the ensuing centuries, gradually became its dominant population. The city, however, retained its multi-ethnic character, a reflection of its importance as a trading post on the junction of the Via Regia and the Amber Road. With the influx of settlers, the town expanded and in 1242 came under German town law. The city council used both Latin and German, and the early forms of the name Breslau, the German name of the city, appeared for the first time in its written records. Polish gradually ceased to be used in the town books, while it survived in the courts until 1337, when it was banned by the new rulers, the german speaking House of Luxembourgs. The enlarged town covered around 60 hectares (150 acres), and the new main market square, surrounded by timber-frame houses, became the trade centre of the town."

In 1308, the town was taken by Brandenburg and the Teutonic Knights restored order. Subsequently, the Knights took over control of the town. The knights colonized the area, replacing local Kashubians and Poles with German settlers. In 1308, they founded Osiek Hakelwerk near the town, initially as a Slavic fishing settlement. In 1340, the Teutonic Knights constructed a large fortress, which became the seat of the knights' Komtur. In 1346 they changed the Town Law of the city, which then consisted only of the Rechtstadt, to Kulm law. In 1358, Danzig joined the Hanseatic League, and became an active member in 1361. It maintained relations with the trade centres Bruges, Novgorod, Lisboa, and Sevilla. Around 1377, the Old Town was equipped with city rights as well.

A Baltic port city, it successively became the capital of the State of the Teutonic Order, the Duchy of Prussia and the provinces of East Prussia and Prussia. From the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries on, the inhabitants spoke predominantly German. Konigsberg joined the Hanseatic League in 1340 and developed into an important port for the south-eastern Baltic region, trading goods throughout Prussia, the Kingdom of Poland, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The chronicler Peter of Dusburg probably wrote his Chronicon terrae Prussiae in Königsberg from 1324 to 1330. After the Teutonic Order's victory over pagan Lithuanians in the 1348 Battle of Streva, Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode established a Cistercian nunnery in the city.

Salt was transported by land (today known as the 'Old Salt Road'), but mainly by water.

The town was built in Prussia around the fortress Ordensburg Marienburg, which was founded in 1274 on the east bank of the river Nogat by the Teutonic Knights. Both the castle and the town were named for their patron saint, the Virgin Mary. This fortified castle became the seat of the Teutonic Order and Europe's largest Gothic fortress.In the course of its eastward expansion, the Teutonic Order secured the conquered territories by building castles. Among these was Marienburg Castle, built between 1270 and 1300 on the banks of the Nogat, an estuary of the Vistula. It originally served as the seat of the land master. The castle was named after the patron saint of the 'Order of the Brothers of the German House of St. Mary in Jerusalem', which was the full name of the Teutonic Order. While the Order achieved great military successes in Eastern Europe, it suffered severe setbacks in the Holy Land. In 1271, its main fortress Montfort was lost. The fortress of Acre, the last stronghold of the Crusaders in the Holy Land, fell in 1291. As a result, the Teutonic Order moved its headquarters to Venice. A decade later, it became clear that a successful reconquest of Palestine was out of the question. Prussia offered itself as an alternative field of activity. When the Order of the Temple was dissolved in 1307 and the Teutonic Order took over Gdansk in 1308 and 1309 respectively, Grand Master Siegfried von Feuchtwangen moved his seat from Venice to Marienburg in September 1309. The fortress was gradually expanded into a castle, as it soon proved too cramped for the representative purposes of such a powerful order. For example, the great chapters of the entire Order took place here, which were also attended by Teutonic Masters and Masters from Livonia and at which the Grand Master of the Order was elected. In the course of the 14th century, representatives of the European high nobility also regularly stayed at Marienburg during Prussian journeys. After the defeat of the Order at the Battle of Tannenberg by Poland-Lithuania, the Marienburg was besieged for the first time in 1410. Heinrich von Plauen succeeded in holding the fortress."
 urban_kulm_desc: "Thorn was founded in 1231 as the first settlement in Kulmerland under the administration of the Teutonic Order. Originally, this was located in the area of the later village of Alt-Thorn about 7.5 km west of the city, but was moved to its later location in 1236 because of the permanent danger of flooding. The Teutonic Order had been called into the country by the Polish Duke Konrad of Masovia in order to Christianise the pagan Baltic Pruzes living in the area. However, the Order only became active after Emperor Frederick II had granted it the right to rule over the land to be conquered in 1226. The foundation stone for the city of Thorn was laid in 1231 by the land master Hermann von Balk. Immigrants from Westphalia populated the city, which received its town charter on 28 December 1233 with the Kulm Handfeste. Thorn is the oldest city in Prussia. Thorn Castle was built in 1260. The city is said to have been named after the fortress and barony of Toron, a crusader castle of the Teutonic Order in the Holy Land. In old documents the city is called Thoren. In the 14th century, Thorn joined the Hanseatic League and thus belonged to the Hanseatic cities like Elbing, Danzig, Königsberg and Kulm. In 1367, Thorn joined the Cologne Confederation of Hanseatic Cities. The Order's efforts to simultaneously expand its sovereignty and control trade led to warlike conflicts and an alliance of German trading cities with the Kingdom of Poland. In 1411, the First Peace of Thorn was signed between the Polish King Władysław II. Jagiełło and the Teutonic Order."

The town was populated by artisans and traders, originating from towns in the northern parts of the Holy Roman Empire. A Teutonic knight, Werner von Orseln, was murdered in Marienburg in 1330. He was among the first to be buried in the newly erected cathedral of the town. St. Dorothea of Montau lived in Marienwerder from 1391 until her death in 1394; future pilgrims visiting her shrine would contribute to the flourishing economy."

Stockholm's location appears in Norse sagas as Agnafit, and in Heimskringla in connection with the legendary king Agne. The earliest written mention of the name Stockholm dates from 1252, by which time the mines in Bergslagen made it an important site in the iron trade. The first part of the name (stock) means log in Swedish, although it may also be connected to an old German word (Stock) meaning fortification. The second part of the name (holm) means islet and is thought to refer to the islet Helgeandsholmen in central Stockholm. According to the Eric Chronicles the city is said to have been founded by Birger Jarl to protect Sweden from sea invasions made by Karelians after the pillage of Sigtuna on Lake Malaren in the summer of 1187. Stockholm's core, was built on the central island next to Helgeandsholmen from the mid-13th century onward.

This led to the construction of Kastelholm Castle by Bo Jonsson Grip († 1386). The castle was first mentioned in a document in 1388. Kastelholm Castle on Åland was an important power factor in the Gulf of Bothnia in the Middle Ages and was a strategically important defence point.

By the 7th century, the locals had built a wooden fortress on the eastern side of Toomemägi Mountain (Toomemägi). Over the next centuries, the settlement grew and became an inland trading centre around the 9th-10th century. The first documentary mention of the area dates back to 1030 by chroniclers of Kievan Rus. Yaroslav I the Wise, Prince of Kiev, invaded the region in that year, built his own fortress there and named it Yuriev. Tartu remained under Russian control until 1061, when, according to the chronicles, Yuriev was burnt down by the Estonian tribe called Sosols. Soon after, the Estonians rebuilt the fortress. In the 12th century, the Estonians on one side and Novgorod and Pskov on the other repeatedly raided each other. In these campaigns Russians captured Tartu in 1133 or 1134 and in the winter of 1191-1192, but these temporary conquests did not bring permanent territorial changes. During the period of the Northern Crusades at the beginning of the 13th century, the fortress of Tarbatu was taken by the Livonian Knights Crusaders and recaptured by the Estonians several times. After Ugaunia recognised the supremacy of the Novgorod and Pskov princes in 1224, who sent additional troops led by Prince Vyachesko of Kukenois to the fortress, it was besieged and captured one last time by the German crusaders. Subsequently, Tartu, known as Dorpat, became a trading centre of considerable importance in the late Middle Ages and the capital of the semi-independent bishopric of Dorpat. In 1262, the army of Prince Dmitri of Pereslavl, son of Alexander Nevsky, attacked Dorpat, captured the city and destroyed it. His troops did not succeed in taking the bishop's fortress on the Vault Hill. In the Middle Ages, after the Livonian Order was subordinated to the Teutonic Order in 1236, the city became an important trading town. In the 1280s Dorpat joined the Hanseatic League.

On this north-south axis, the castle in Kaunas represented an important obstacle to the ambitions of the Teutonic Order. With the crushing defeat of the Teutonic Order in the Battle of Tannenberg against the united Lithuanians and Poles in July 1410, this conflict was decided in favour of the Lithuanians. The town then lost its importance as a fortress, but experienced an upswing as a trading town. After the settlement had already received Magdeburg city rights in 1408, a Hanseatic trading post was opened in 1440.

The first reports of the Narva fortress date back to 1256, which was built near the village of Narvia, initially on the other side of the Narva River. The town grew rapidly, probably receiving the Lübeck town charter from the King of Denmark as early as 1302. In 1329 Narva was called castrum et civitas for the first time - a fortress and a town. In 1341 - 1342 during the Livonian War, the Pskov princedom troops burnt Narva to the ground.  The town was quickly rebuilt, for as early as July 25, 1345, King Valdemar IV. Atterdag of Denmark granted Narva city rights once again. In 1347, the Danish king sold North Estonia and with it the town of Narva to the Livonian Order."

Hrodna received its town charter from the Lithuanian prince Vytautas in 1391. The prince also donated the parish church to the town and had two of the three castles located here expanded. After the Battle of Tannenberg, the town quickly flourished from 1410 onwards, expanding territorially. Hrodna was ruled by two mayors, one Catholic and one Orthodox. The town experienced its golden age during the reign of the Jagiellonian and Wasa dynasties. During the time of Stefan Batory, Hrodna became the de facto capital of the Polish-Lithuanian Empire. The old castle was expanded at that time, and a Jesuit school was established. Hrodna was the seat of the Crown Tribunal, the highest court for the territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania."

After Jazdow was raided by nearby clans and dukes, a new fortified settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called 'Warszowa'. The Prince of Plock, Boleslaw II of Masovia, established the modern-day city in about 1300 and the first historical document attesting to the existence of a castellany dates to 1313. With the completion of St John's Cathedral in 1390, Warsaw became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia and was officially made capital of the Masovian Duchy in 1413."

The area around Łęczyca was already settled in the 6th century, but the settlement at that time was near a ducal castle on the site of the village of Tum to the east of the town, which was surrounded by large marshes. Łęczyca was then most likely the capital of a pagan tribal principality. After the introduction of Christianity under Mieszko I, the town became the seat of one of seven castellanies that formed the Polish state. Bolesław I founded a Benedictine abbey in Łęczyca at the beginning of the 11th century. After the death of Duke Bolesław III Schiefmund, Poland disintegrated into many small principalities; the nominal capital Krakow lay far from central Poland and was fiercely contested by princely feuds. The ecclesiastical authorities therefore chose Łęczyca as the venue for the synods, which were always held in summer. The first Polish synod and sejm were held in Łęczyca in 1180. The town can therefore justifiably claim to have been Poland's summer capital. In 1263 the duchy of Łęczyca was divided into two small states, the principalities of Łęczyca and Sieradz. In 1267 Łęczyca received its town charter from Duke Leszek II the Black. However, the town only flourished under Leszek's nephew, the last Piast king, Casimir III the Great, who built the fortified castle and town walls that still exist today. King Władysław II. Jagiełło also promoted the city and made it the place of the Sejm's meetings. From 1339 the town was the seat of the Łęczyca Voivodeship."

Some Tatars also went to Lithuania, brought by Vytautas the Great. Kazan became the centre of the principality, which was dependent on the Golden Horde. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Kazan grew and became an important trade and political centre within the Golden Horde. The city's growth was also encouraged by its successful geographical location at the intersection of the main trade routes between East and West. In the same period, the minting of coins began with the indication of the place of minting. In 1438, the Bulgarian fortress of Kazan was taken by the overthrown Khan Ulug Muhammad, who killed the local Prince Swan and moved the fortress. The city became the capital of the Khanate of Kazan. The city bazaar, Tas Ayaq (Stonefoot) became the most important trading centre in the region, especially for furniture. Handicraft production also flourished as the city became known for its leather and gold products and for the wealth of its palaces and mosques. Kazan maintained trade relations with Moscow, Crimea, Turkey and other regions. "

In 1097, an independent principality of Murom-Ryazan broke away from the principality of Chernigov. In 1239, in the course of the Mongol invasion of Rus, the troops of the Golden Horde under Batu Khan appeared at the city gates. As a result, Murom was devastated and burnt down.

Towards the end of the 12th century, the Pomors explored the entire northern coast of the peninsula and reached Finnmark, forcing the Norwegians to support a naval guard in the area. The name the Pomors gave to the north coast was Murman - a distorted form of Norman, meaning 'Norwegian'. The Pomors were soon followed by tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the Kola Peninsula gradually became part of the Novgorod lands.A 1265 treaty between Yaroslav Yaroslavovich and Novgorod mentions Tre Volost, which is later mentioned in other documents."

In 15 BC, the Romans fortified the frontier city they called Vindobona to guard the empire against Germanic tribes to the north. In 976, Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March, a district centered on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria. This initial district grew into the duchy of Austria. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1145, Duke Henry II Jasomirgott moved the Babenberg family residence from Klosterneuburg in Lower Austria to Vienna. From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty. In 1440, Vienna became the resident city of the Habsburg dynasty. It eventually grew to become the de facto capital of the Holy Roman Empire in 1437 and a cultural center for arts and science, music and fine cuisine."

 urban_graz_desc: "In the 6th century Slavs, as subjects of the Avars, invaded the sparsely populated land and founded the principality of Carantania on the territory of present-day Carinthia, Styria and Carniola. Slavs later also built a castle at this site - grad in Old Church Slavonic, Slovenian gradec 'small castle, fortified place'. The place name 'Graz' is derived from this. The first definite mention of Graz dates back to 1140, when Udalrich of Graz attested in a document to the establishment of the Augustinian canons' monastery at St. Marein an der Feistritz by Adalram von Waldeck. Leopold's son, Ottokar III, was able to win for himself the regalia that had previously belonged to the king in this area for the country that was in the process of being created. The foundation of the second large market in Graz also dates from around 1160. When Ottokar III died in 1164, everything seemed to indicate that this upswing would be short-lived, for he left only a son of just one year, Ottokar IV, for whom his widow Kunigunde took over the regency. But Styria remained a single entity. As the last of his marks, the Carantanian Mark had split off from the Duchy of Carinthia. Ottokar I of the Bavarian count family of the Traungau, as well as his successors, were margraves of the Carantanian Marches from 1056. Emperor Frederick Barbarossa elevated the Carantanian Margraviate, which was also called Styria after the ancestral castle of Steyr, to an independent duchy in 1180, which retained the Margraviate name. As Ottokar IV remained childless, he contacted the Babenberg duke Leopold V.. They met and concluded an inheritance treaty in 1186, in which the Traungauer designated the Babenberger as his heir. Around 1233 Graz had all the external and legal features necessary for a city: a market, its own jurisdiction and a fortification. In 1379 Graz became the residence of the Habsburgs - the Habsburgs lived in Graz Castle and ruled Inner Austria from there."

To secure the connection across the Danube, the Romans built a wooden earthen fort in the middle of the 1st century, which was replaced by a larger stone fort in the 2nd century. After the 2nd century, Lentia was destroyed several times by Germanic invasions, but survived the storms of the migration of peoples and thus has a continuity of settlement beyond Late Antiquity. In the early Middle Ages, Linz became more important again as the Bavarian duchy advanced eastwards. In 799, the German name of the town was first mentioned in a document as 'Linze'. In the Raffelstetten customs order (between 902 and 906), Linz is mentioned for the first time as a royal market and customs town. During the rule of the Carolingians, Linz fulfilled market and customs duties for the Traungau. Until 1210 Linz was under the rule of the Babenberg dukes. Under the Babenbergs, Linz developed into a city, which was laid out according to plan in 1207, incorporating the old settlement core. In 1230 the new main square was created. By 1240 Linz had been given a town magistrate and a town seal. The Linz toll was one of the most important sources of income for the Austrian dukes, which helped the city to flourish. In 1335 the acquisition of Carinthia by the Habsburgs was completed there. From the end of the 13th century Linz was the seat of the provincial governor, and thus became the central town of Austria above the Enns. Frederick III even chose the city as his residence and thus made it the centre of the Holy Roman Empire from 1489 to 1493, after Matthias Corvinus had conquered Vienna. On the one hand, this and the court of Duke Albrecht VI, which was in Linz from 1458 to 1462, increased the city's cultural and political importance, but at the same time the demands of court life placed a burden on the city. The first Upper Austrian Diet was held in Enns in 1408."

 urban_praha_desc: "Prague is the capital and largest city of Bohemia. The region was settled as early as the Paleolithic age. Jewish chronicler David Solomon Ganz, citing Cyriacus Spangenberg, claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in 1306 BC by an ancient king, Boyya. In the late 5th century AD, during the great Migration Period following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the Slavic tribes settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the Czech tribes built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the sarka valley, Butovice and Levy Hradec. The legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess Libuse and her husband, Premysl, founder of the Premyslid dynasty. Legend says that Libuse came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied 'I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars'.

The settlement core of today's Kosice was formed by a Slavic settlement in today's Kovacska Street. Parallel to this old settlement, whose exact date of origin is unknown, German colonists founded a trading settlement in the neighbourhood at the beginning of the 13th century. Still in the 13th century, the two settlements merged, and the resulting Slavic-German settlement received its first city rights around 1248 as one of the first cities in the kingdom. Shortly before, in 1230, there was the first written mention of the town (as villa Cassa). In the following centuries, Kashov was one of the most important and largest towns in the Kingdom of Hungary. Due to its location on a trade route to Poland and various privileges, trade flourished and its importance grew. The first guild rules have been handed down from 1307. After the defeat of the Aba family by the troops of Charles I at the Battle of Rozhanovce in 1312, several rights were borrowed from the town as compensation. In 1347 Kashov became the second royal free town in the Kingdom of Hungary after the capital Buda. In 1369 the town was granted its coat of arms by King Louis the Great. This was the first sovereign grant of a coat of arms to a legal entity in Europe. Until then, this privilege had only existed for natural persons. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the development of the town reached its peak. In the 15th century, the town played an important role in the Pentapolitana - a union of five towns in present-day eastern Slovakia - Kosice, Presov, Bardejov, Sabinov and Levoca. In the middle of the 15th century it came under the rule of John Giskra. "

Under Roman rule, the city prospered; there is evidence of a governor's palace, several amphitheatres and baths, and the city, which was situated on the endangered Roman Danube border, was also provided with a wall. At the end of the 4th century, in the course of the migration of peoples, Germanic and Hunnic-Albanian tribes increasingly invaded; after the fall of the Roman Empire and the end of the migration of peoples, a Slavic population initially settled here, but from 896 they were displaced by Hungarians, Uralic peoples who migrated to the Pannonian lowlands. The Hungarians, who were later Christianised and settled down, lived in villages with churches and practised agriculture and animal husbandry. Pest became increasingly important at the centre of important traffic routes. Already at this time, there was a lively ferry traffic across the Danube to Buda on the other side. With the coronation of Stephen I (on Christmas Day 1000 or 1 January 1001) as the first king of Hungary, the Hungarians extended their dominance.

Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia at the foot of the Little Carpathians, occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava. Bordering Austria and Hungary, it is the only national capital to border two sovereign states. The city's history has been influenced by people of many nations and religions, including Austrians, Bulgarians, Croats, Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, Romani and Slovaks.The Celtic tribe of the Boians founded a fortified settlement (oppidum) in today's city centre around 115 BC, where there was, among other things, a mint. From the 1st to the 4th century AD, the area south of the Danube was under Roman rule (in the south), while the actual city area north of the Danube belonged to Germania magna. From the time towards the turn of the century until 568 AD, the area belonged to the empire of the Germanic Quades. The Slavs reached the area around 580, after the Quades had left for Italy with the Lombards. In reaction to the domination of the Avars, the settling Slavic tribes rebelled and founded the Empire of Samo in 623. From the end of the 8th century until 833, the castles of Pressburg and Thebes were important centres of the principality of Nitra and, after 833, of Great Moravia. In the second half of the 9th century, the Bratislava area was part of the Carolingian Ostmark. The first documented mention of the city was in 907 in connection with the battles of Pressburg between Bavarians and Magyars, from which the latter emerged victorious. After the German victory over the Hungarians in the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, German settlement began on both sides of the Danube ford near Pressburg, which was promoted by the Hungarian kings after the turn of the millennium. Subsequently, a market settlement developed below the castle, which was repeatedly exposed to attacks by other powers due to its strategic location on Hungary's western border. There were repeated disputes between Hungarians and Bavarian, then Austrian, Bohemian and Roman-German princes or kings. Later, the Pressburg Chapter came into being; the oldest surviving enacted document dates from 1236. According to the account of the Arab cartographer al-Idrisi, Buzana in the 12th century was a 'flourishing medium-sized town with many inhabitants and enough various things and food for survival' and densely built-up. After the devastation of the surrounding countryside by the Mongols ('Tatars') in 1241, the market town of Pressburg was resettled by Germans. On 2 December 1291, the Hungarian King Andrew III granted the town charter. In the late Middle Ages, Pressburg was a town characterised by vineyards, crafts, trade and fishing.

 urban_split_desc: "Split was founded in the 4th or 3rd century BC as the Greek colony of Aspalathos or Spalathos and became an administrative seat in the Roman Empire no later than 312. In 1097 Spalato briefly came under Venetian rule, but this ended in 1105. After that, it came under the protection of the Hungarian King Koloman. In 1242, a Tartar invasion reached the gates of the town, but Spalato held out. In the diadochal struggles following the extinction of the Arpad dynasty (1301), Venice was able to win Spalato back for itself (1327). The city subordinated itself to Venice, which now appointed and dispatched the Comes. He was both chief official of the city and representative of the Doge. The city law was codified in 1312 by Perceval of Fermo in the Libro d'oro (Golden Book). No sooner had a new dynasty, Louis I, established itself and this king defeated Venice in 1357 than it ceded Spalato and the other cities back to Croatia in 1358 in the Peace of Zadar. The death of Louis I in 1382 weakened Hungary, so that in 1390 King Tvrtko I seized the city for his kingdom of Bosnia. But already his successor Stjepan Dabisa had to recognise the suzerainty of Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary-Croatia (later also Holy Roman Emperor) in 1394 and cede Spalato to him. In 1402, Spalato had to recognise King Ladislaus of Naples, who claimed Dalmatia for himself, as lord, enforced by his viceroy Hrvoje Vukcic Hrvatinic of Dalmatia and Croatia, who henceforth also called himself Duke of Spalato. But when Sigismund defeated Ladislaus, Hrvoje fell away from him and subordinated himself to Sigismund, who forgave him for taking Ladislaus' side in 1403. Duke Hrvoje rose to high-handed tyranny, so the commune expelled him in 1413 and no longer recognised him as duke, quelling a revolt by his partisans in the city. Spalato prevented Hrvoje's return by voluntarily submitting to Venice in 1420. "

 urban_beograd_desc: "Belgrade, sometimes called the 'White City' is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and at the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Belgrade is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe and the world. One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vinca culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singidun. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284."

Despite the supreme authority of the Franks, these territories had a certain degree of independence, especially for Prince Mihajlo Visevic Humski (910 - 950). The area was ruled for a time by the Nemanjics, then by the Bosnian Ban and in the 14th century by Stjepan Vukcic Kosaca. The foundation of the town of Mostar is related to the construction of two towers / fortifications in the mid-15th century, probably in the time of Duke Stjepan. The fort on the right bank of the Neretva was called Tara and on the left Helebija. The Herceguša tower was built next to the Tara tower. It was used for defensive purposes and also to guard the former wooden suspension bridge. It was built during the reign of Duke Stjepan, after whom it was named. " 
 urban_ragusa_desc: "The origins of Ragusa can be traced back to the 2nd millennium BC, when there were several Sicel settlements in the area. After the Slavs had driven out the population of Epidaurum, they settled in this city. They also founded a settlement on the mainland at the foot of Mount Sergius opposite the island to which the Roman population had fled, on a piece of land covered by a dense oak forest. Since the oak was called dub in Slavic, the name Dubrovnik was most likely formed from it. Over time, friendly relations developed between the island settlement and the Slavic population on the mainland. In the 12th century, the channel between the mainland and the island was filled in, causing the two settlements to grow together. Ragusa was under the protection of Byzantium since its foundation. Bosnia became an important supplier of raw materials to the city (wood and metals). At the same time, important trade routes to the interior of south-eastern Europe ran through Bosnia. At the time of the Crusades, the city was temporarily under the rule of Venice (1205-1358). In 1242, the city was besieged by the Mongols and the surrounding countryside was devastated. In 1240 and 1244 the alliance with Bosnia was renewed. After the peace treaty of Zadar in 1358, Ragusa recognised the suzerainty of the Croatian-Hungarian kings and paid tribute to them. However, as early as 1420, delegations travelled regularly to the Ottomans, who, in addition to affirming their neutrality, delivered annual tributes. After gaining its autonomy (only tributes in the form of taxes and ships were paid to the Hungarian-Croatian king), Ragusa began its life as an independent Republic of Ragusa. The republic managed to preserve its autonomy and the citizens of the city elected their city council and senate. The patron saint of the city became St. Blasius, a doctor from the time of Diocletian, who, according to tradition, saved Dubrovnik during an attack by the Republic of Venice. In 1416, the Republic of Ragusa was the first city-state in Europe to abolish slavery; at the same time, the slave trade was prohibited by law. "

First under Bulgarian, then Byzantine influence, Zeta gained a measure of independence under Constantine Bodin, but was united with Rascia by Nemanja in 1185. From 1280 to 1314, Helene d'Anjou ruled over Zeta. From 1360 to 1421, after the disintegration of the Serbian Empire, Zeta was ruled by the local Balsic princes, and the capital was moved to Shkodra.

The city is built west of the Iskar river, and has many mineral springs. It has a humid continental climate. Being in the centre of the Balkans, it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, and closest to the Aegean Sea. Known as Serdica in Antiquity and Sredets in the Middle Ages, Sofia has been an area of human habitation since at least 7000 BC. The recorded history of the city begins with the attestation of the conquest of Serdica by the Roman Republic in 29 BC from the Celtic tribe Serdi. During the decline of the Roman Empire, the city was raided by Huns, Visigoths, Avars and Slavs. In 809, Serdica was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire by Khan Krum and became known as Sredets. In 1018, the Byzantines ended Bulgarian rule until 1194, when it was reincorporated by the reborn Bulgarian Empire. Sredets became a major administrative, economic, cultural and literary hub until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1382."

The name Colonia Flavia Pacis Deultensium was later transferred to the Thracian city. During this period it became the second most important city in the Roman province of Thracia and the centre of its lands. There, a branch of the Roman army road Via Militaris met the Via Pontica, which connected the coastal towns along the Pontos Euxeinos. Later, on the southern slopes of the nearby Hemus Mountains (Balkan Mountains), the town of Aquae Calidae was built, a spa with mineral springs rich in water, which was demonstrably visited regularly by Byzantine emperors and empresses. After the division of the Imperium Romanum in 395, the region belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire (later Byzantium). Under the rule of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527-565), Aquae Calidae was secured by a fortress wall. In 708, the Bulgarian ruler Terwel, directly north of today's Burgas, defeated the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II in the Battle of Anchialos and thus was able to incorporate the region of Sagore with Aquae Calidae and Develtum into the Bulgarian Empire for the first time. Under the Bulgarian ruler Krum, Sagore became part of the Bulgarian Empire permanently. In this context, the Bulgarian ruler had the Bulgarian-Byzantine border wall Erkesija built. Around 970, the region again came under Byzantine rule. In 1093, Alexios I Komnenos stationed troops in Aquae Calidae to secure the eastern passes of the Balkan Mountains. In 1206, Aquae Calidae, by then known as Thermopolis, was destroyed by the Latin Emperor Henry, but later rebuilt by Bulgarians and Byzantines. In 1270 Poros was mentioned in a document of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1304, the Battle of Skafida took place at Poros, where the Bulgarian Tsar Todor Svetoslav defeated the Byzantines and conquered the southern Black Sea coast. In 1332, the Bulgarians under Tsar Ivan Alexander managed to defeat the Byzantines under Emperor Andronikos III again near Burgas, in the Battle of Rusokastro."  
 urban_silistra_desc: "Silistra was founded by the Romans in 29 AD as Durostorum (often also Dorostorum) and was an important military base, as well as a river port and road station in the province of Moesia on the Danube Limes. In the 7th century, Slavs settled in the region and named the city Drastar. When, towards the end of the century, the Bulgarians of Asparuch pushed into the Balkans, Drastar and the Slavic tribe of Severs became part of the Bulgarian Empire. Drastar became the summer residence of the Bulgarian khans, who built their capital in Pliska. After the Christianisation of the Bulgarians in 865, the diocese of Drastar was formed as one of the first dioceses of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Under Tsar Simeon I, the city had strategic importance in the empire's defensive struggle against the Magyars. In 969, Drastar was one of the first Bulgarian fortresses to be affected by the conquests of the Grand Prince of Kievan Rus, Svyatoslav I. As the expansion of Kievan Rus into the Balkans threatened the political balance of the region, Byzantium under Emperor John Tzimiskes intervened. By 971, the eastern part of the Bulgarian Empire was conquered by Byzantium and Svyatoslav was forced to retreat. The city was given the name Theodoroupolis after the Byzantine reconquest in 971 because the Byzantines attributed it to the help of Saint Theodoros to have defeated Sviatoslav in the fortress of Silistra. In 976, the later Bulgarian emperor Samuil reconquered the region between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube, as well as the city, and resided here. In 1001, the Byzantine Emperor Basileios II sent his army, which subsequently subjugated the region again. For the following decades, Drastar became the centre of the Byzantine province of Paristrion. After 1186, Silistra became part of the Second Bulgarian Empire. After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, Silistra fell to the Ottomans. "

Trade routes from Belgrade and the Sava River to the south and from Croatia and Bosnia to the coast of the Adriatic Sea ran through Priština. In the foundation charter of King Stefan Uroš II Milutin to the Banjska Monastery in 1315/16, the road connection on the Field of Blackbirds is called the Priština Road. During the reign of Stefan Uroš II Milutin (1282-1321) and his successors, Priština also served as one of the residences of the Serbian monarchs, where the respective imperial days were held in turn. Following the coronation of Stefan Dušan as emperor in 1349, the city was formally subordinated to Dušan's co-regent Stefan Uroš V. The southern parts of the Serbian Empire fell to the Mrnjavcevici after Dušan's death in 1355. Priština, however, remained in the territory of Tsar Uroš V. Following the Battle of the Marica in 1371, Priština fell into the possession of Lazar Hrebeljanovic. After Lazar married his eldest daughter Mara to Vuk Brankovic in 1370 or 1371, he also gave Priština to his son-in-law, where he then established the centre of his feudal rule. After Priština, as Vuk's seat of power, was threatened as early as 1387 by a large Ottoman force personally led by Murat I, the historic Battle of the Field of Blackbirds took place on 28 June 1389 after intensive preparations, the result of which initiated a permanent Ottoman presence. Sultan Bayezid I annexed Priština and its entire principality by the end of 1395, but was unable to effectively integrate the possessions into the Ottoman administration in the face of the advance of the Mongols under Timur in 1402 and had to cede them to the rival principality of the Lazarevici, as he was also dependent on the financial and military support of Stefan Lazarevic in the campaign against Timur. Under Stefan Lazarevic, mining and trade flourished after the crushing defeat of the Ottomans at Ankara. This gave the despotate a significant short-term cultural and economic boost, as well as a respite from the Ottomans' renewed policy of conquest."

The population included Greeks, Armenians, Wallachians, Tatars and Ligurians, who exported grain, wax and honey, and imported wine and cloth. Before 1368, the Genoese abandoned Kilija in favour of the voivodes of the Vltava. As the starting point of the major trade routes (Wallachian route to Hungary, Moldavian route to Poland), the town became a bone of contention between Hungary, the Romanian princes, Poland and the High Porte in the 15th century.

The city was named after the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy. The 11th and 12th centuries were the Golden Age of Byzantine art in Athens.

 urban_heraklion_desc: "When the Byzantine Empire was crushed by the Fourth Crusade, Crete was initially to fall to the Lombard margrave Boniface I of Montferrat. However, he was more interested in Salonika and exchanged it with the Republic of Venice. The version of the city's name, Candia, Italianised under the Venetians, soon spread to the whole island of Crete. The town of Candia became the residence of the Duca, the 'Duke of Crete', appointed by the Republic of Venice. The first duke was Jacopo Tiepolo. The city also became the seat of a Roman Catholic archbishop. The island's landowning aristocracy, newly assembled by the Republic of St Mark, had to be present in the town of Candia and maintain residences befitting their status. The most important trade goods, namely iron, wheat and olive oil, were declared state monopolies. The port was considerably expanded in the first six decades of the 14th century, but this was partially financed in 1359 with the introduction of the tornesello, an artificially overpriced coin that circulated only in the eastern colonies. Nevertheless, from 1229, when the last Greek revolt collapsed, until 1363, there was a long period of prosperity and relative peace on the island, except for the revolt under Alexios Kalergis (1283-1299), which covered almost the entire island. When the Empire of Nikaia succeeded in regaining Constantinople in 1261, thus denying Venice access to the market there for a long time, Candia became the most important Venetian port in the Aegean. Through drastic tax increases, restrictions on the Cretans' trade on their own account in favour of the Venetian long-distance merchant families, as well as lavish services, the Senate provoked uprisings on the island, especially the great revolt of 1363 to 1366. After the recapture of the capital, which was first celebrated in Candia on 10 May 1365, this victory was henceforth celebrated every year with processions and horse races. In the long term, the revolt weakened the influence of the local Venetian nobility and strengthened the Greek families. "

As a result of the 4th Crusade, Corfu came under the rule of the despot of Epiros after 1204. As a dowry of Helen of Epirus, the island had come into the possession of Manfred of Sicily in 1258. From this time onwards, numerous fiefs were issued to Frankish nobles on the island.  After the murder of Philip Chinard, the crusader Garnier l'Aleman took over the administration of Corfu. Charles contacted Garnier l'Aleman and offered him land in the Kingdom of Sicily of an annual value of 100 ounces, or 1000 ounces of gold in cash, for 'the whole island of Corfu with castles with country houses and all the lands of the usurpers'. In fact, Garnier gave the island to Charles of Anjou in March 1267, who appointed him his captain-general on 20 March 1267 and gradually conquered the despotate of Epirus from 1268. Charles' promise in favour of Garnier could no longer be carried out due to his death. A document dated May 1272 shows that Charles had the promised land of the above-mentioned annual value of 100 ounces or 1000 ounces of gold allotted in cash to the son of the deceased Garnier, Aimone Aleman. In 1271 Giovanni Clariaco became the first Vicar of Corfu. Under Angevin rule, the feudal system of Western European coinage came into full formation. In 1294 the island was transferred from Charles II of Anjou to his son Philip, Prince of Taranto, who in 1330 (or shortly afterwards) appointed Guglielmo II Tocco governor of Corfu. In 1352 Robert of Taranto took control of Corfu. Under Charles III, Corfu fell to the Venetians in 1383. Besides the capital, Angelokastro and Gardiki were the most important fortresses of the Venetian colonies. Cultural influences of the western feudal lords combined with the local Greek Orthodox traditions to form an independent culture. "

From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe. The city became famous for its architectural masterpieces, such as Hagia Sophia, the cathedral of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which served as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the sacred Imperial Palace where the emperors lived, the Hippodrome, the Golden Gate of the Land Walls, and opulent aristocratic palaces. The University of Constantinople was founded in the fifth century and contained artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453, including its vast Imperial Library which contained the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and had 100,000 volumes. The city was the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the Crown of thorns and the True Cross.

This initial construction consisted of a single curtain wall with towers, which now forms the inner circuit of the Theodosian Walls.

During the Crusades, Antioch served as the capital of the Principality of Antioch, one of four Crusader states that were founded in the Levant. The city's location offered geographical, military, and economic benefits to its occupants; Antioch was heavily involved in the spice trade and lay within easy reach of the Silk Road and the Royal Road. Seleucus encouraged Greeks from all over the Mediterranean to settle in the city. Antioch was part of the pentarchy and was called 'the cradle of Christianity' as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of early Christianity. The Christian New Testament asserts that the name 'Christian' first emerged in Antioch. The city declined to relative insignificance during the Middle Ages due to warfare, repeated earthquakes, and a change in trade routes. The city still lends its name to Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, one of the most important churches of the Levant and eastern Mediterranean."

In its pre-Roman times it was known as Odrysia, probably in reference to the Thracian tribe of the Odrysians, or Uscudama, and belonged to Thrace. Odrysia was the capital of the Odrysian Empire from the 5th to the 3rd century BC. Between 171 BC and 168 BC, the area was occupied by the Romans. During his reign, Augustus renounced the conquest of Thrace and thus also of the city. Thrace was not conquered until the reign of Emperor Claudius. Hadrian ordered the city to be rebuilt and expanded around 125 AD and gave it the name Hadrianopolis (City of Hadrian). In 378 the Romans under Emperor Valens were defeated there by the Goths (Battle of Adrianople). In 395 the city became the centre of the Roman province of Haemimontus. The city was the seat of the Archbishopric of Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto, which still lives on today as a titular bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church. Around 790-800, the city became the centre of the newly created Byzantine military-administrative district of Macedonia. In subsequent centuries, rule over the city and the subject alternated between the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires. In 813, the Bulgarians under Khan Krum were victorious over Emperor Michael I in the Battle of Adrianople. Tsar Simeon I reincorporated the province into the Bulgarian Empire in 914. In 927, after the 50-year peace agreement between Bulgarians and Byzantines, much of the subject again came under Byzantine rule. In 1204 Adrianople was conquered by the Crusaders, but fell again into Bulgarian hands after the Battle of Adrianople of 1205. A final Byzantine period followed after 1250, and the Ottomans finally conquered the city in 1362. From 1368 Edirne was the capital of the Ottoman Empire."

Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative and cultural center of Armenia. The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BCE, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BCE by King Argishti I of Urartu at the western extreme of the Ararat Plain. Erebuni was designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital. During the last quarter of the 14th century, the Aq Qoyunlu Sunni Oghuz Turkic tribe took over Armenia, including Yerevan. In 1400, Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia, and captured more than 60,000 of the survived local people as slaves. Many districts including Yerevan were depopulated."

Within a short time, the city evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center of the Muslim world. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multiethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the 'Center of Learning'. The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires."

The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (0.375 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre."
