Greece is but a springboard for our people to reclaim the empire that we once had. Before we can restore the glory of the Roman empire, we must begin by restoring Greece to our control and in the process expel those infidels who had brought misery, destruction, and scandal to the face and glory of Greece and her monuments. In time and with patience we will retake Italia and Roma back from the hands of those barbarians and the heretical leader they call their Pope."

Now it is time that we the sons of Mars march in and liberate these thespians from their infidel overlords. Let us go forth and take back Thessaly, for Greece and for Rome!"

A citty once renowned for having housed some of the greatest, the finest minds in all of Europe. Socrates, Plato, Pericles, Solon and the greatest Athenian of them all, Themistocles. We must help to rebuild Athens as the centre of democratic thinking, whilst at the same time expelling all heathens from within her city walls.

 recovery_of_gaul_title:0 "Recovery of Gaul"
 recovery_of_gaul_desc:0 "Gaul was once the richest region in the western empire and one of the richest regions in the empire as a whole in terms of population and taxes gained through vast arable lands; a shinning jewel and the crowning achievement of Julius Ceasar himself. However, the fall of Gaul "to the roaming barbarians" in the 4th century not only hastened the demise of the Empire as a whole but also contributed to the rise of the savage Franks and to that despicable Imperial usurper Charlemagne and his seed. The title of "Holy Roman Emperor" that every Frankish or Germanic King has laid claim to on the throne of Ceasar must not be allowed to continue. Rome must unite and show to the rest of the world "through the might of its legions" that there can only be one true "Holy Roman Emperor". It is time to finally reverse the course of history and take back Gaul for the glory of the Empire."
 recover_germania_inferior_title:0 "Into Germania Inferior"

 rule_over_britannia_title:0 "Invasion of Britannia"
 rule_over_britannia_desc:0 "The island of Britannia, despite centuries of barbarian inhabitation still holds a fond memory within the minds of every Roman, for it was Rome that once brought civilization and prosperity to its misty shores. This being said, Britannia is still one of the few places in Europe with vast tin and copper reserves, not to mention gold deposits in the region of Wales. With the return of our legions, Britannia will once again be brought back into our imperial fold, with the option of rebuilding Hadrian's wall to keep the barbarian Scots at bay or to go right and over the higlands, til there is only one ruler on this rainy and windswept island."
 invasion_of_scotland_title:0 "Over the Wall"
 invasion_of_scotland_desc:0 "Despite the long rule of our people over the Britons many centuries ago, our armies have never actually gone beyond the wall to take the whole of Britannia. Rumor has it though that Alba has potentially rich in minerals reserves, which its primitive inhabitants have yet to fully harvest. With the final conquest of Hibernia now under wraps, it is now time to finally send forth our legions into the mists of Scotland and take what is ours from those who are inferior to us."
 recover_the_rest_of_spain_title:0 "Into Hispania"
 recover_the_rest_of_spain_desc:0 "Having now secured Hispania's coast, Rome must now go in and seize the rest of the peninsula in order to take back control of Hispania's rich mineral reserves and fertile horse pastures. Hispania was once one Roman and our legions should once again make it so."
 recover_spanish_coastline_title:0 "The Hispanic Coast"
 recover_spanish_coastline_desc:0 "Seville, Granada, New Carthage now Cartagena along with Valencia and Barcelona all sit along Hispania's southern and southwestern coast, a rich coastal region that benefits from the prosperous centers of trade within the Western Mediterranean. It is vital for Rome to take back this area if the resurgent empire is to benefit from and control all trade within the Mediterranean sea or Mare Internum."
 invasion_of_hibernia_title:0 "Luck of the Irish"
 invasion_of_hibernia_desc:0 "Despite Rome's centuries knowledge of Hibernia, no actual formal Roman invasion has ever been conducted. Whether this was due to uncertainty at the time or rumors and tales of savages more fierce than those of the Britons, Rome must now decide whether or not to continue tolerating the existence of this mysterious island on close to its shores or to take a chance by bring civilization to its inhabitants through the tip of the gladius? One thing is certain, Rome now has the resources, manpower and new found confidence in itself to carry out any mission it show chooses or desires."
 recover_germania_superior_title:0 "Crossing the Rhine"
 recover_germania_superior_desc:0 "Many historians and philosophers have debated as to why our Empire "ultimately" fell apart. Many have blamed civil war, terrible plagues, poor administration of the Empire's financial coffers and the inclusion of barbarians into our sacred Roman legions. All these reasons may seem justly founded on historical facts but we and every Roman know that the fall of our Empire was not mainly due to these things, but rather due to the unification and systematic attacks across our Northern borders by the Germanic and barbarian hordes. Many a times the Empire had gone through civil wars, its people through plagues and there has always been corruption on some form or another. However, systematic attacks by Germanic and steppe hordes contributed mainly to its fall and destruction over a millenia ago. We as Romans must now finally come together and bring the full brunt and weight of our armies on Germania and its savage people. We must take the lessons of the past and apply what we've learnt over the centuries to finally be-rid ourselves of the menace across the Danube, otherwise Rome may once again fall indefinitely if we do not act!"

Now wooden ships have been sighted off the shores of the Nile Delta flying what seems to be red, blue and white colours.

Hence, the intelligentsia has tasked our administration to locate a new source of labor and what better place to start looking than in Africa. Besides, for hundreds of years both the Arabs, Indian and Chinese merchants have been dealing in the slave trade over there, not to mention our European rivals such as the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and French all get their labor force from Africa, so why can't we? It may be an immoral trade but how can we as a nation compete on the global stage if we sit idly by and ignore the resources that the Dark continent has to offer, whatever shape or form they may be. We have plenty of weapons that we can trade with local Africans along the Ivory and Gold coasts for slaves, slaves who are themselves kidnapped and sold to foreigners by their own people.

Can anyone blame them for coveting such vast and rich lands? We would bring dishonor if we said yes for India is a land full of riches, yet at the same time wrapped in a shroud of mystery. Tales of revered pagan Hindu Gods spew forth from the mouths of Sikhs, Monks and commoners a like and the smell of aromatic spices fill the air amongst the cacophony of sounds and bells chiming within huge step-pyramid like temples with interiors covered in gold, whilst numerous golden pagan idols studded in diamonds, pearls, saphires and rubies at every altar, not to mention the local savage nobles known as Maharajas who are carried around in golden chairs, covered in fine silks adorned with gold-diamond jewelry and rings laden with sapphire and ruby stones. It is even said that the greatest ruler of them all, the Great Mughal Emperor lavishes himself even more whilst sitting upon a peacock throne plated in gold, studded with diamonds and precious stones. The Portuguese hearing of India's riches and hungry for her spices quickly established trading ports at Goa and the newly independent Dutch are eying nearby Sri Lanka with the intent of also establishing a port their. Our government on the other hand has been relatively slow to commit and invest in India, something we may end up regretting if we do not act soon, for it is rumored that the French are also preparing an expeditionary force to India in hopes that France will also set up base on the peninsula. The admiralty and their Majesties have tasked us with not only preventing any French moves but also with the capture of Indian ports on both sides of the sub-continent. Our sources in India have proposed that we set-up a settlement along the Ganges and Surat rivers, with the over arching goal of India's complete subjugation through military force if needs be.

These temples are not only only held in admiration and respect by locals and Buddhist monks alike but because of the Golden pagan images and statues of Buddha himself that can be found within them.

The trade that flows out of Chinese ports such as Canton can not be understated, for the Pearl River Estuary is the main financial artery into and out of China and is always busily crowded with ships "Junks" that are laden with gold, silks, tea, china-wares and other precious goods and commodities. Through our observations and analysis of China's situation. The Admiralty has concluded that Britain must take a slice of the pie, which can be done through the seizure of a remote and relatively ignored island known as Kowloon. Kowloon it-self has no fresh water source and is very sparsely populated with people primarily concentrated within the small fishing village of Hong Kong. This may present a problem in the future, for the only way to grow any potential settlement there is to venture forth onto the mainland and seize a chunk of the adjacent shore. China though has vast armies can still pack quite a punch en-mass despite being technologically backwards. This is why the military board has suggested that in order for us to take Kowloon and any nearby land that we must carry out a different tactic, one involving a certain drug known as Opium! The Chinese are addicted to this stuff and hopefully will be too stoned to do anything or stand up to our armies when battle on land or at sea commences. Our government has also ordered us to take any peace offer involving the island of Kowloon and the nearby adjacent lands, even if it only means renting the island for 100 years, since the money we'll make off trade there will more than surpass any maintenance costs that this potential new colony will incur."

This not only gives our competitors and those closer to India in terms of geography the upper edge when it comes to profits. This cannot go on if we are to maintain the people's support in this enterprise. We must therefore outfit an expedition in order to find alternative sea route to India and the spice islands.

 october_revolution.1.d:0 "Throughout June, July, and August 1917, it was common to hear working-class Russians speak about their lack of confidence and misgivings with those in power in the Provisional Government. Factory workers around Russia felt unhappy with the growing shortages of food, supplies, and other materials. They blamed their own managers or foremen and would even attack them in the factories. The workers blamed many rich and influential individuals, such as elites in positions of power, for the overall shortage of food and poor living conditions. Workers labelled these rich and powerful individuals as opponents of the Revolution, and called them words such as \"bourgeois, capitalist, and imperialist\". In September and October 1917, there were mass strike actions by the Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in Baku, textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and railroad workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, more than a million workers took part in strikes. Workers established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a social revolution. Workers were able to organize these strikes through factory committees. The factory committees represented the workers and were able to negotiate better working conditions, pay, and hours. Even though workplace conditions may have been increasing in quality, the overall quality of life for workers was not improving. There were still shortages of food and the increased wages workers had obtained did little to provide for their families. By October 1917, peasant uprisings were common. While the uprisings varied in severity, complete uprisings and seizures of the land were not uncommon. The October Revolution had started."

The Bolsheviks delayed the assault because the revolutionaries could not find functioning artillery. The Bolsheviks also prolonged the assault for fear of violence since the insurrection did not generate violent outbreaks. At 6:15 p.m., a large group of artillery cadets abandoned the palace, taking their artillery with them. At 8:00 p.m., 200 cossacks left the palace and returned to their barracks. While the cabinet of the provisional government within the palace debated what action to take, the Bolsheviks issued an ultimatum to surrender. Workers and soldiers occupied the last of the telegraph stations, cutting off the cabinet's communications with loyal military forces outside the city. As the night progressed, crowds of insurgents surrounded the palace, and many infiltrated it. While soviet historians and officials tended to depict the event in heroic terms, the insurrection and even the seizure of the Winter Palace happened almost without resistance. At 9:45 p.m, the cruiser Aurora fired a blank shot from the harbor. Some of the revolutionaries entered the Palace at 10:25 p.m. and there was a mass entry 3 hours later. By 2:10 a.m on 26 October Bolshevik forces had gained control of the palace. After sporadic gunfire throughout the building, the cabinet of the provisional government had surrendered."

 construct_petra_renovated_desc: "The treasure city of Petra lies on the slope of Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah valley. For generations, historians have both wondered and speculated as to its true purpose, but recent excavations and observations have led many to conclude that the city "built by the Nabataeans" was it-self divided into different areas, with a treasure vault "occupying the famous facade that greets all incoming visitors" on one end followed by a series of buildings on the skirts "dug into the mountains" where inhabitants, traders and officials would reside. One of the many reasons why so many historians have been skeptical on the purpose of Petra is because the Nabataeans were originally a nomadic group. So to suggest that they all of a sudden gave that up to settle down "historians feel" only leads to more unanswered questions as to why and what caused this sudden and drastic shift in the Nabataean's own sedentary attitudes."
