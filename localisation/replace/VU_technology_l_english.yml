 mil_tech_cs_0_desc:0 "The citizen soldier, the tribal warrior, essentially the non-professional. The starting point for any military."
 mil_tech_cs_1_desc:0 "The creation of a professional military class is the first step to creation of a modern army."
 mil_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "In the late 12th century, siege warfare saw the emergence of advanced siege engines designed to breach fortified defenses. Trebuchets, massive counterweight catapults, launched projectiles with accuracy and power, while battering rams, large wooden beams with metal heads, aimed to break through gates and walls. Siege towers provided mobile platforms for scaling fortifications, and catapults like mangonels and ballistae flung projectiles or bolts at high velocities. These advancements in siege engine technology revolutionized the tactics and strategies used during sieges, enabling attackers to effectively breach or weaken fortifications."
 mil_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "By the 13th Century the land armies had become more professional and well organized. Better systems are in place to support the mix of levies and professional soldiers that now dominate the battle fields and the power of infantry is slowly but steadily gaining on the cavalry arm."
 mil_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "Charging blindly at the enemy is perhaps not the greatest tactic known to man, but it is one of the simplest to master. It is also the stepping stone to more advanced strategies."
 mil_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "In archery, a recurve bow is one of the main shapes a bow can take, with limbs that curve away from the archer when unstrung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than the equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for given arrow energy, and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback."
 mil_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "The longsword, a versatile and iconic weapon of the medieval period, exemplified the art and skill of swordsmanship. With its double-edged blade and hilt suitable for two-handed or one-handed grip, the longsword offered a balance of offense and defense. It was wielded by knights and skilled warriors who trained rigorously in combat techniques. The mastery of the longsword required not only physical strength but also finesse and precise control. It symbolized the honor, prowess, and martial culture of the medieval era."
 mil_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "Brigandine armor, a type of body armor, gained popularity during the medieval era. It consisted of metal plates riveted or sewn onto a fabric or leather base, offering protection to the wearer. Brigandine armor was flexible, providing a balance between mobility and defense. It became a favored choice for knights, men-at-arms, and soldiers on the battlefield, as it offered reliable protection against slashing and piercing attacks."
 mil_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "The Crusades, a series of religious and military campaigns, had a profound impact on medieval Europe. The return of Crusaders brought back not only religious relics but also knowledge, ideas, and cultural influences from the Middle East. The Crusades served as a catalyst for increased contact and exchange between Europe and the Islamic world. This cultural interchange influenced various aspects of medieval society, including art, architecture, literature, science, and the overall worldview of the people."
 mil_tech_cs_9_desc:0 "The pike, a long spear-like weapon, became a prominent feature on medieval battlefields. It was favored by infantry formations for its reach, defensive capabilities, and effectiveness against cavalry charges. Pikes were often used in tightly packed formations, creating a formidable barrier that deterred enemy attacks. The use of pikes revolutionized battlefield tactics, leading to the development of new military formations and strategies. It symbolized the evolution of warfare and the importance of disciplined infantry in medieval conflicts."
 mil_tech_cs_10_desc:0 "The Crusades left a lasting impact on the societies and regions involved. The aftermath of these campaigns brought forth various consequences, such as cultural exchanges, economic transformations, and political realignments. The returning Crusaders introduced new ideas, technologies, and goods, sparking a wave of innovation and change. The Crusades also reshaped power dynamics and sparked conflicts and tensions that would continue to reverberate in subsequent centuries."
 mil_tech_cs_11_desc:0 "Heavy cavalry was a class of cavalry intended to deliver a battlefield charge and also to act as a tactical reserve; they are also often termed shock cavalry. Although their equipment differed greatly depending on the region and historical period, heavy cavalry were generally mounted on large powerful warhorses, wore body armor, and armed with either lances, swords, maces, flails (disputed), battle axes, or war hammers; their mounts may also have been protected by barding."
 mil_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "Plate armor, composed of metal plates interconnected by rivets or straps, provided superior protection to knights and warriors on the battlefield. It offered coverage for vital areas of the body, including the head, torso, arms, and legs. Plate armor was designed to deflect or absorb the impact of weapons, such as swords, arrows, or maces. The use of plate armor represented a significant advancement in personal protection, enhancing the defensive capabilities of medieval warriors."
 mil_tech_cs_13_desc:0 "Heavy knights, also known as armored or fully-armed knights, represented the pinnacle of medieval chivalry and warfare. Clad in full plate armor and equipped with powerful weapons, they were formidable forces on the battlefield. Heavy knights engaged in mounted combat, wielding weapons such as lances, swords, and maces. Their training, skill, and heavy armor made them the elite warriors of their time, embodying the ideals of chivalry and serving as the backbone of medieval armies."
 mil_tech_cs_14_desc:0 "The Hundred Years War was a prolonged conflict between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, spanning the 14th and 15th centuries. This war had far-reaching political, social, and military consequences, shaping the histories of both nations. It witnessed significant military innovations, such as the use of longbows and gunpowder weapons, and marked a transition from feudal warfare to professional armies. The Hundred Years War left a lasting impact on European history and warfare strategies."
 mil_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "Late medieval armies underwent significant changes, both in terms of composition and tactics. The emergence of professional standing armies, the integration of gunpowder weapons, and the increased reliance on infantry formations transformed the face of warfare. Knights, infantry, archers, and artillery units worked in coordination to achieve strategic objectives. The late medieval period witnessed the evolution of military strategies and the rise of disciplined, well-organized armies."
 mil_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "Maritime conflicts and rivalries over control of the seas were a defining feature of the medieval era. Nations vied for dominance over key trade routes, engaged in naval battles, and established naval powers to protect their interests. Control of the seas had immense economic and strategic significance, as it facilitated trade, colonization, and the projection of military power. The fight over the seas shaped the course of medieval history."
 mil_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "The concept of swarm warfare refers to the strategic deployment of large numbers of troops in coordinated, rapid maneuvers. This tactic, often employed during medieval battles, aimed to overwhelm the enemy through sheer numbers and create chaos on the battlefield. Swarming tactics required disciplined and well-trained soldiers capable of executing synchronized movements. The use of swarm warfare had a profound impact on the outcome of battles and influenced military strategies of the time."
 mil_tech_cs_18_desc:0 "Logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines with food, armaments, ammunitions, and spare parts apart from the transportation of troops themselves."
 mil_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "Moats, water-filled ditches surrounding fortifications, were a common defensive feature in medieval castles and cities. Moats served as a formidable obstacle for attackers, hindering their progress and providing additional protection to the defenders. They acted as a physical barrier, making it challenging for siege engines and troops to breach the fortified walls. Moats were an essential element of medieval military architecture and contributed to the defensive strategies of the time."
 mil_tech_cs_20_desc:0 "Cart warfare, also known as war wagons or taborite wagons, was a unique military tactic employed during the medieval period, particularly in Eastern Europe. It involved the use of heavily armored wagons equipped with cannons or firearms, providing mobile firepower and protection for troops. Cart warfare allowed for flexible and rapid movement on the battlefield, challenging traditional infantry tactics and contributing to the evolution of warfare strategies."
 mil_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "Throughout the middle ages cavalry's dominance was being challenged by disciplined pikemen. In battles such as Bannockburn or the Golden Spurs, cavalry was defeated by pikes. A combination of improved training and discipline, and the addition of swordsmen to provide close combat support has raised this formation to the peak of its efficiency."
 mil_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "A pike is a remarkably simple weapon to make, but to get the full benefit from the use of pikes, it's required for the whole formation to be wielding weapons of similar length and blade."
 mil_tech_cs_23_desc:0 "Although hand cannons had been developed in China in the 12th century and had spread to Europe by the 14th, the weakness of these weapons reduced their battlefield utility. Light and reliable Arquebus was able to displace bow due to three main factors. It had better armor penetration, it was easier to train men to use it, and it did not rely on the strength of the user."
 mil_tech_cs_24_desc:0 "Artillery had been documented in Europe since the thirteenth century, but due to its lack of mobility, it had very limited battlefield use. The development of the Limber in the 1470s allowed guns to become more mobile and thus useful."
 mil_tech_cs_25_desc:0 "The Arquebus was easy to use as a weapon, but was also inaccurate and slow to fire, leaving its user vulnerable to cavalry charges. Blending with Pikemen allowed Arquebusiers to fire and then fall back to be shielded by Pikemen when enemy cavalry or infantry appeared."
 mil_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "The value of training and experience has always been great on the battlefield. With the advent of gunpowder and the tactical changes associated with it and other infantry weapons came a great demand for units versed in these new innovations. As professional armies were still far away this need had to be filled by mercenary units such as the Condottieri, Swiss Mercenaries or Landsknechte. A growing class of professional mercenary officers came to live of supplying these regiments to needing states in the middle of the military transition."
 mil_tech_cs_27_desc:0 "Pike and shot formations proved a major threat to medieval knights. The initial response was heavier armor to counter the power of gunpowder weapons, but this slowed down cavalry, reducing their shock power. Reiters were usually armed with two pistols and a sword, allowing them to either shoot or charge depending on the opposition they faced."
 mil_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "The Arquebus proved to be a very effective weapon for armor penetration, the result was that armor began to get heavier to resist its fire. A larger musket could deliver a heavier round offering better armor penetration "
 mil_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "Spanish Square developed naturally from the Pike and shot formations. At its core was a traditional Pike Square. At each of the corners it had a group of Arquebusiers. It kept the staying power of the traditional pike square and enhanced it with the firepower of the Arquebus."
 mil_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "The new and more mobile artillery had one problem - it could not be easily elevated up and down to adjust its firing range. Trunnions were cylindrical protrusions that acted as mounts for the gun on its carriage, which allowed it to be tilted and thus aimed better."
 mil_tech_cs_31_desc:0 "It was difficult to fire around curved walls, thus once attackers got close enough to the fortification, the ability of other parts of the defenses to provide flanking fire was nullified. The development of star-shaped bastions allowed every part of the wall to be supported from other parts."
 mil_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "The size and depth of the Spanish Square gave it staying power but made it slow and cumbersome to maneuver on the battlefield. It also led to a large percentage of troops being inactive during battles. Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, reduced the total number of men in the formation to make it more mobile and reduced its depth, so it maintained the same firepower and shock values."
 mil_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "With artillery's growing importance in the battlefield, also the number of firearms kept increasing. But because each gun was made separately, it also required great effort to resupply. In 1544, Emperor Charles V declared that there would be only 5 calibres of gun, while King Henry II of France set 6 standard calibres."
 mil_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "The matchlock firing mechanism's biggest weakness was the need to keep the match lit in order to fire the weapon. Although wheellock was developed, it was too expensive to produce to enter into mass use. The development of flintlock created a more reliable weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "The carbine was a shorter form of the musket."
 mil_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, further developed infantry units to improve their firepower. His infantry formations were narrowed and made rectangular to increase the number of muskets that could fire in each volley. Attachment of small artillery pieces further increased the firepower of infantry."
 mil_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "With development of new bastions engineers began to improve the art of positioning them to channel attacking armies into specially prepared killing grounds, where the defenders could inflict maximum amount of casualties on their enemy."
 mil_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "Thanks to bayonets, each musketeer could function as a pikeman as well. This allowed pikes to be removed from infantry equipment and provided infantry formations with more firepower."
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "In the 1620s the idea of combining the shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, allowed for faster reloading and thus firing. This in turn dramatically improved the firepower of guns."
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "Heavily armored cavalrymen were by their nature cumbersome to form up and vulnerable on the battlefield. Lighter cavalry was added to armies to act as scouts for the army during marching and screen heavier cavalry before its charge on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_41_desc:0 "An outer ditch became a key area for the siege. If attacking troops gained control of the glacis, then the bastions would be lost. The ditch became the first line of defense for a fort. Access to this ditch, and ensuring it kept providing protection to defending troops became a key part of fortification design."
 mil_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "Improvements in metallurgy allowed cannons to become lighter and more reliable. This allowed them to become more effective on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_43_desc:0 "First introduced to the Austrian army as irregular troops from the military frontier during the Seven Years war, Light Infantry Companies were deployed in loose order and proved to be very effective at harassing enemy and leading assaults on entrenchments."
 mil_tech_cs_44_desc:0 "Although a musket could always be wielded as a club, it was not an effective hand-to-hand weapon. A bayonet was a blade that was fitted to the end of a musket, allowing the weapon to function as a spear. Initial bayonet designs plugged the barrel, making it an either or choice, but the development of the ring bayonet, which fitted around the barrel, turned a musket into a useful support weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "Although a cuirass (or a breast plate) had existed for many years, only recently a new style of cavalryman gained popularity, with only a breast and back plate, which provided better balance between protection to the key parts of the body and mobility."
 mil_tech_cs_46_desc:0 "Thanks to the building of several layers of fortification, overrunning of outer bastions simply moved the siege to the next layer, forcing attackers to prepare new locations to site guns and increasing the length of the siege."
 mil_tech_cs_47_desc:0 "The introduction of light infantry troops led to a change in warfare. Skirmishers were deployed forward in loose order to distract and harass the enemy before the main infantry attack, which was typically delivered in either a line or a column."
 mil_tech_cs_48_desc:0 "The musket's weakness was the fact that it was highly inaccurate beyond 50 yards. The rifle, although never a standard infantry weapon, added greater range to elite units, which gave the army a greater overall punch."
 mil_tech_cs_49_desc:0 "Dragoons is a designation that has been used to refer to certain heavy cavalry regiments in the British Army since the 18th century. While the Prussian and Russian armies of the same period included dragoon regiments among their respective Imperial Guards, different titles were applied to these units."
 mil_tech_cs_50_desc:0 "Originally developed for siege purposes, the howitzer fired a high angled projectile over the fortifications and into the town inside. The field howitzer, a lighter more mobile variant, would fire an explosive shell above enemy troops. Mixed with other artillery types, it added to the effectiveness of artillery brigades."
 mil_tech_cs_51_desc:0 "The percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, was the crucial invention that enabled muzzleloading firearms to fire reliably in any weather. The percussion cap replaced the flint, the steel 'frizzen', and the powder pan of the flint-lock mechanism."
 mil_tech_cs_52_desc:0 "The Minié ball, or Minni ball, is a type of muzzle-loading spin-stabilized rifle bullet named after its co-developer, Claude-Étienne Minié, inventor of the Minié rifle. The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile which was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun."
 mil_tech_cs_53_desc:0 "A rifled breech loader is an artillery piece which, unlike the smooth-bore cannon and rifled muzzle loader which preceded it, has rifling in the barrel and is loaded from the breech at the rear of the gun. The spin imparted by the gun's rifling gives projectiles directional stability and increased range. Loading from the rear of the gun leaves the crew less exposed to enemy fire, allows smaller gun emplacements or turrets, and allows a faster rate of fire."
 mil_tech_cs_54_desc:0 "European armies continued to develop bolt-action rifles through the late 19th century, adopting tubular magazines and later box magazines. The Mauser Gewehr 98 was considered the epitome of this type of action, and its descendents became the standard against which all such rifles are measured. World War I marked the height of the bolt-action rifle's use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs."
 mil_tech_cs_55_desc:0 "The mechanism of the Maxim Gun employed one of the earliest recoil-operated firing systems. This system made it vastly more efficient and less labor-intensive than previous rapid-firing guns."
 mil_tech_cs_56_desc:0 "Indirect fire is aiming and firing a projectile without relying on a direct line of sight between the gun and its target. Aiming is performed by calculating azimuth and elevation angles, and may include correcting aim by observing the fall of shot and calculating new angles."
 mil_tech_cs_57_desc:0 "Although technology had dramatically changed the nature of warfare by 1914, the armies of the major combatants had not fully absorbed the implications. In the face of modern warfare, digging in was standard practice. To attack frontally was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy."

 adm_tech_cs_0_desc:0 "The most basic unit of governance is an extended family where all members of a community claim kinship with each other, a tribe in other words."
 adm_tech_cs_1_desc:0 "A family structure with most senior members at the top can work for nonrelated groups. In its simplest form, the system is meritocratic, with leadership tasks assigned to the most capable."
 adm_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "As social organization improves, so do things like food production. Increasing food production allows a society to upkeep people who aren't producers of food themselves. This leads to creation of a military elite, to defend against enemy's military elite. Supporting of the military elite is the basis of the feudal system."
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "With a military elite to govern our society, the next stage of development is to have a literate class of administrators. Usually these will be drawn from the ranks of clergy."
 adm_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "Royal charters have been a common practice throughout history, with their origins dating back to ancient civilizations. However, they gained significant prominence and usage during the medieval and early modern periods, particularly from the 12th to the 18th centuries. During this time, royal charters were extensively employed by monarchs in Europe to grant privileges, establish colonies, regulate trade, create corporations, and shape the governance of towns and institutions. While the usage of royal charters has evolved over time, they continue to hold importance in various legal and administrative contexts even in contemporary times."
 adm_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "In various periods of history, rulers and governments have made efforts to centralize power and authority. These centralization attempts aimed to consolidate governance, streamline administration, and strengthen control over territories. Whether through the establishment of bureaucratic systems, legal reforms, or political maneuvers, centralization attempts have shaped the course of nations and influenced the balance of power."
 adm_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "The establishment of parliaments and republican regimes marked significant milestones in the evolution of governance and political systems. These institutions arose from a desire for broader participation, representation, and the limitation of monarchical power. Through parliaments, elected representatives and leaders gathered to debate, make laws, and shape the policies and direction of a nation. Republican regimes aimed to establish a form of government where power resided in the citizens and not a hereditary ruler. These developments contributed to the growth of democratic principles and the rights of individuals."
 adm_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "Agriculture formed the backbone of medieval society, providing sustenance, economic stability, and the foundation for growth. Crop cultivation and animal husbandry techniques improved over time, leading to increased agricultural productivity. Fields were cultivated, livestock were raised, and agricultural surpluses fueled trade and urbanization. The advancements in agricultural practices and technologies played a crucial role in shaping the medieval economy and society."
 adm_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "Legal systems in the medieval period were complex and varied, influenced by local customs, feudal hierarchy, and religious laws. These systems encompassed civil and criminal laws, regulations for trade and commerce, and laws governing social interactions. Legal authorities, such as judges, jurists, and royal courts, played a crucial role in administering justice and resolving disputes. The development of legal systems helped maintain order, regulate societal conduct, and uphold the rights and obligations of individuals."
 adm_tech_cs_9_desc:0 "Religion played a central role in medieval life, shaping beliefs, values, and societal structures. The influence of Christianity pervaded all aspects of society, from personal faith to political power. Churches, cathedrals, monasteries, and religious orders were significant institutions, providing spiritual guidance, education, and charitable services. The medieval period also witnessed the emergence of religious movements and sects that challenged established norms and doctrines. Religion was a powerful force that unified communities, provided solace, and influenced cultural expressions."
 adm_tech_cs_10_desc:0 "The growth of medieval states and empires led to the emergence of bureaucratic systems to manage administrative tasks. Bureaucracy encompassed a network of government officials, administrators, and clerks who carried out various administrative functions, such as record-keeping, taxation, law enforcement, and policy implementation. Bureaucratic structures and procedures helped centralize power, ensure efficient governance, and maintain social order."
 adm_tech_cs_11_desc:0 "The medieval period witnessed the emergence of new forms of government and governance structures. Feudalism began to give way to centralized monarchies, city-states, and republics. These new governments aimed to consolidate power, establish laws and regulations, and promote stability and order within their jurisdictions. The transition to new governance models marked a significant shift in political dynamics, paving the way for future developments in governance and the rise of nation-states."
 adm_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "The establishment of civil service systems marked a significant development in medieval governance. Trained officials were appointed to administrative positions based on merit and expertise, rather than inherited or acquired through noble status. Civil servants played a crucial role in implementing policies, maintaining records, and providing administrative support to rulers and governing bodies. The introduction of civil service systems brought efficiency, professionalism, and a meritocratic approach to government administration."
 adm_tech_cs_13_desc:0 "The role of the constable in medieval society was multifaceted. Constables were appointed officials responsible for maintaining law and order within a specific jurisdiction. They acted as peacekeepers, overseeing the enforcement of laws, apprehending criminals, and managing local security. Constables played a crucial role in maintaining social order, ensuring the safety of communities, and upholding the authority of the ruling powers."
 adm_tech_cs_14_desc:0 "The establishment of organized courts in medieval societies brought structure and legitimacy to the administration of justice. Courts provided a forum for resolving disputes, interpreting laws, and delivering judgments. Judges, magistrates, and legal professionals presided over court proceedings, ensuring fairness and adherence to legal principles. Organized courts played a vital role in upholding the rule of law, safeguarding individual rights, and maintaining social order."
 adm_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "The medieval period saw the development of various forms of early machinery that revolutionized industries and daily life. Watermills, windmills, and mechanical clocks were among the notable inventions of the time. These machines enhanced productivity, enabled new manufacturing processes, and provided a more accurate measurement of time. Early machinery laid the foundation for future technological advancements and shaped the course of human civilization."
 adm_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "Royal officials formed an integral part of medieval governance systems. These individuals were appointed by monarchs and held administrative positions responsible for implementing policies, collecting taxes, managing resources, and maintaining law and order. Royal officials played a key role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the state and upholding the authority of the ruling power."
 adm_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "The late feudal period was characterized by the gradual transformation and decline of the feudal system. Centralized monarchies gained more power, while the authority of feudal lords diminished. Economic changes, social mobility, and political shifts contributed to the transformation of feudal relationships. The late feudal era witnessed the emergence of new societal structures and laid the groundwork for the transition to more centralized forms of governance."
 adm_tech_cs_18_desc:0 "Improved tax collection systems were implemented during the medieval period to facilitate the collection of revenue by central authorities. These systems involved the establishment of efficient tax assessment methods, the standardization of tax rates, and the enforcement of tax compliance. Better tax collection contributed to the financial stability of governments, enabling them to fund their operations and invest in infrastructure and defense."
 adm_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "The Council of Constance was a major ecclesiastical gathering held in the 15th century. It aimed to resolve the Western Schism, a period of division and multiple claimants to the papacy. The council deliberated on matters of church reform, elected a new pope, and addressed theological and political issues of the time. The Council of Constance played a crucial role in restoring unity and stability within the Catholic Church"
 adm_tech_cs_20_desc:0 "The Hussite wars were a series of conflicts that took place in the early 15th century in the Kingdom of Bohemia. These wars were fueled by religious and social unrest, with the Hussites, followers of Jan Hus, challenging the authority of the Catholic Church. The Hussite armies employed innovative military tactics, including the use of mobile wagons as fortifications, which posed a formidable challenge to their opponents. The Hussite wars had a profound impact on the religious and political landscape of the region."
 adm_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "Housing the machinery of government is as important as the machinery itself and one should never forget of the importance of religion when doing so."
 adm_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "Choosing the direction a country is going to take is perhaps the toughest choice a ruler will ever face. National ideas are the concepts that will shape our country for years to come."
 adm_tech_cs_23_desc:0 "Prior to the Industrial Revolution the Workshop- or Putting-out System was used in Early Modern Europe to organize the production of everything from Textiles to Wrought Iron. With materials provided craftsmen could refine various goods either in workshops or in their own home, bypassing the rigid restrictions of the guilds."
 adm_tech_cs_24_desc:0 "The notion of a noble oligarchy ruling the society has existed, since well, at least the Roman times, and remained popular in some parts of the world. Now this idea is once more gaining popularity amongst those who matter."
 adm_tech_cs_25_desc:0 "The problem with a hereditary local nobility is that they tend to value their local interests over those of the rest of the nation. We need to steadily expand the reach of the government, which begins with the most important area of administration, justice."
 adm_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "Although it has been in existence for a long time, the scythe somehow still isn't the most popular tool for harvesting crops. By encouraging peasants to use a scythe instead of a sickle we will improve the efficiency of our harvests."
 adm_tech_cs_27_desc:0 "The development of the social structure is not exclusive to the aristocracy. The clergy too have to improve their internal governance. This will assist in the development of modern thought in our country."
 adm_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "Textiles were manufactured since time immemorial. The invention of stocking frame in 1589 was the first step towards the industrial revolution and the beginning of mechanization. This invention would lead to increase in textile production."
 adm_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "In time it became apparent that a more centralized bureaucracy with administrative bodies run by educated officials employed directly by the state was a necessity for the ambitious projects of the Early Modern rulers."
 adm_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "The more land we can cultivate, the bigger the population we can feed in that area. Gradual improvements in drainage have led to wetlands being brought into use."
 adm_tech_cs_31_desc:0 "While it is true that we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors it is high time that we start to learn about the world from our own, well documented observations. By observing the world around us and by experimenting to prove or disprove our ideas about it we can reach further than those before us."
 adm_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "The ever increasing armies of the 16th century put bigger and harder demands on the administrative systems of states. By creating a permanent organization charged with taking care of the procuring and planning of Military supplies and by keeping more troops on the rolls even during wintertime or peacetime we will in the long run be able to field large armies more cheaply and be able to support these armies more efficiently while at war."
 adm_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "The process to produce wrought iron was under continuous improvement and by the early 17th century the finery process came to overtake the older Osmond process. Iron production could now be specialized with the working of the iron no longer taking place at the same location as it was mined and more, stronger and purer iron would in time lead to developments in many other sectors."
 adm_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "The great medieval universities were of course great but they were not able to produce enough graduates to staff our growing administration. We need to expand our universities or we will fall behind."
 adm_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "The many and long wars of the first half of the 17th century have led to an international diplomatic system where the territorial integrity of states is a cornerstone. States rather than individual rulers or supra-national groupings are the actors on the international arena and no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."
 adm_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "Promotion of religion will be crucial for the stability of the realm. It is not enough to be great, people must be able to see our greatness. The ancients knew how to display their greatness and we will do the same by building monuments to withstand the test of time."
 adm_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "There are many people who demand to be given a role in the government, but in reality mostly want rewards without effort. A new interesting idea of absolutism is spreading, which is a system where we dispose of those parasites and govern alone."
 adm_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "Large-scale woodlands are of course useful as a source of firewood and a place for hunting, but if the trees were to go, those lands could be used for farming instead."
 adm_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "A new philosophical concept called constitutionalism has been developed, where the government accepts legal limits to its power. This is an intriguing idea, but I can't see it catching on."
 adm_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "The new sciences have given us a number of different ways to describe and measure the world around us. Let us send these learned men out into the world in general and into our country in particular. We cannot know what resources are at our disposal until we have thoroughly searched all our lands for minerals, counted every last subject and assessed every last enterprise."
 adm_tech_cs_41_desc:0 "Paying for the upkeep of the army, the navy and the administration itself accounts for the majority of the expenses for any state. As these are expenses that can run away quickly, however, taxes and tolls can be frustrating and inflexible ways to raise the money needed. While national debt is far from unheard of we need to come up with better plans for raising money. Bonds, tontines and other similar plans can be used both domestically and abroad to finance unforeseen expenses and will allow us to make much better use of the money we do have to develop our country."
 adm_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "Having the technical means to improve land and thus production is useless without incentives to do so. By reforming the laws of land tenure we can provide greater incentives to adopt improved methods of production."
 adm_tech_cs_43_desc:1 "An anonymous treatise on political theory has emerged, and despite efforts to suppress it it is quickly spreading across the world. It deals with the nature of forms of government, be they monarchies, despotisms, or democracies, and argues for a strict separation of the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. This would protect the people and limit the power of a monarch, which is understandably a very popular prospect for many of our subjects. Despite the unfortunate implications for the power of monarchs, these ideas may well benefit our nation greatly."
 adm_tech_cs_44_desc:0 "In order to make the most of the lands and subjects we control we must enlarge, reorganize and professionalize our bureaucracy. A robust organization can handle each part of our state and eliminate the need for ad hoc solutions. Let us put our universities at work to consider the best ways to efficiently rule and govern and let us encourage the sons of the nobility to serve the state with a pen in hand rather than a sword."
 adm_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "The basic plow in use in Europe has been unchanged since the Roman times. Now, thanks to improvements in design, the same plough can be made much lighter, reducing workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_cs_46_desc:1 "At the forefront of current revolutionary thought is the radical notion of equality for all. Philosophers from different parts of the world have worked together to create a document entitled the 'Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen', proclaiming that these rights are universal and should be enforced by law. It is likely that this will have ample repercussions for the development and spread of the concepts of freedom and democracy, and we would do well not to lag behind."
 adm_tech_cs_47_desc:0 "Fortunately for us, the so-called enlightened philosophers didn't restrict themselves to writing subversive political treaties, but they also have come up with ideas in the areas of science and engineering. These are a boon to our economy and have led to an increase in production."
 adm_tech_cs_48_desc:0 "These foolish revolutionaries think they can simply consign hundreds of years of progress to the dustbin of history, all in the name of such outlandish concepts as liberty and equality. We will defeat them through the tried and tested plan of stealing the bits and pieces of their ideas that we like."
 adm_tech_cs_49_desc:0 "A factory, manufacturing plant or a production plant is an industrial facility, often a complex consisting of several buildings filled with machinery, where workers manufacture items or operate machines which process each item into another."
 adm_tech_cs_50_desc:0 "My secretary of state assures me that the switch to clover as a fodder crop and the addition of the turnip in a 'four field' rotation will increase yields in agriculture. I am inclined to promote this idea."
 adm_tech_cs_51_desc:0 "The invention of steam power has led to significantly better means of transportation. With railroads we can transport goods and people very quickly over vast distances."
 adm_tech_cs_52_desc:0 "In the modern world tolerance and equality are becoming increasingly important. Our advisors suggest that we look into the possibility of abolishing the idea of state religion in favor of secularism."
 adm_tech_cs_53_desc:0 "In the 19th century in Europe and North America, there were movements advocating universal male suffrage. The democratic movement of the late 19th century, unifying social democrats, particularly in Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand used the slogan Equal and Common Suffrage."
 adm_tech_cs_54_desc:0 "Making machines from regulated replaceable parts will save a lot of resources as the whole machine won't have to be replaced if just one part of it breaks."
 adm_tech_cs_55_desc:0 "Assembly lines, designed for the sequential organization of workers, machines and parts, would allow faster manufacturing of goods along with decreased workload for the workers."
 adm_tech_cs_56_desc:0 "Progressivism is the support for or advocacy of improvement of society by reform. As a philosophy, it is based on the idea of progress, which asserts that advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization are vital to the improvement of the human condition."
 adm_tech_cs_57_desc:0 "With the increased supply of electricity we are now able to bring it to all major factories. That would allow them to produce greater amounts of products."

 dip_tech_cs_0_desc:0 "Shipbuilding can mean a lot of different things, it is amazing how far you can get on a raft for example. However, this is not the same as creating a fleet to enforce policies of a state. This requires a whole different approach to the building of ships, as well as developing ways to control the navy you've build."
 dip_tech_cs_1_desc:0 "The patterns of trade had been seriously disrupted in the 14th century, possibly due to plagues and pandemics. Now trade is slowly beginning to recover."
 dip_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "Banking in the 12th century saw the emergence of moneylenders and merchant-bankers who provided loans and facilitated international trade. Moneylenders offered loans with interest, despite certain restrictions, while merchant-bankers played a crucial role in transferring funds and providing credit for long-distance commerce. The use of bills of exchange allowed for secure and convenient money transfers, reducing the need for physical currency transport. Cities like Florence and Venice became financial hubs, establishing banking houses and networks that laid the groundwork for future financial advancements."
 dip_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "Knarr is the Old Norse term for a type of ship built for long sea voyages and used during the Viking expansion. The knarr was a cargo ship; the hull was wider, deeper and shorter than a longship, and could take more cargo and be operated by smaller crews."
 dip_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "Urbanisation refers to the process of population growth and the development of cities. Throughout history, urbanisation has been driven by factors such as economic opportunities, technological advancements, and social changes. Cities have served as centers of commerce, culture, and political power, attracting people from rural areas and fostering innovation and exchange. Urbanisation has had profound impacts on society, shaping the dynamics of governance, social structure, and urban planning."
 dip_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "Guilds were associations of artisans and merchants that played a crucial role in medieval trade and commerce. These organizations provided a platform for skilled individuals to come together, share knowledge, regulate their respective crafts, and protect their interests. Guilds also ensured quality control, set standards, and provided social welfare support to their members. They served as economic and social institutions, fostering cooperation, specialization, and the growth of industries."
 dip_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "Ports and harbors served as vital hubs of trade and maritime activities during the medieval period. These coastal or riverside locations provided access to both domestic and international markets. Ports facilitated the exchange of goods, fostered cultural exchange, and acted as gateways to distant lands. They were bustling centers of commerce, where merchants, sailors, and travelers converged, bringing with them goods, ideas, and stories from faraway places."
 dip_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "The medieval period witnessed a significant expansion of trade routes, fueled by growing demand for goods, exploration, and advancements in maritime technology. Trade networks connected distant regions, facilitating the exchange of commodities, ideas, and cultures. Silk Road, Hanseatic League, and other trade routes played vital roles in bridging continents and fostering economic prosperity. These trade routes opened up new avenues for commerce, diplomacy, and the diffusion of knowledge and innovations."
 dip_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "The medieval period witnessed the rise of financial practices and institutions that facilitated economic transactions and capital flow. Moneylenders, bankers, and financial networks emerged, offering loans, investment opportunities, and currency exchange services. These financial intermediaries played a critical role in facilitating trade, financing enterprises, and supporting the growth of urban centers. The development of financial systems laid the groundwork for future advancements in banking, accounting, and economic infrastructure."
 dip_tech_cs_9_desc:0 "As trade and economic activities expanded, the need for standardized currencies and banking institutions became evident. Coins, representing specific values, were minted by governments and circulated as mediums of exchange. Banking houses and money changers facilitated currency exchange, lending, and financial transactions. The establishment of currency and banking systems promoted economic stability, facilitated commerce, and encouraged investment and entrepreneurship."
 dip_tech_cs_10_desc:0 "Urban centers experienced significant growth during the medieval period, driven by factors such as trade, population increase, and technological advancements. Cities became vibrant hubs of economic activity, cultural exchange, and intellectual pursuits. They provided opportunities for social mobility, attracted skilled craftsmen, and served as centers of learning and innovation. The growth of cities reshaped social structures, influenced artistic and architectural styles, and played a crucial role in the overall development of medieval society."
 dip_tech_cs_11_desc:0 "The medieval period saw the emergence of early torpedo-like devices known as "fire ships" or "torpedoes." These were naval weapons filled with flammable materials, such as pitch, tar, or gunpowder, and propelled towards enemy vessels to cause damage through fire or explosion. Fire ships were employed in naval battles to disrupt enemy formations and create chaos. The development of these early torpedoes revolutionized naval warfare tactics and added a new dimension to naval conflicts."
 dip_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "Medieval fleets were maritime forces composed of various types of ships, including warships, merchant vessels, and transport ships. These fleets served multiple purposes, such as protecting trade routes, conducting naval expeditions, and supporting military campaigns. Naval fleets played a pivotal role in projecting power, establishing dominance at sea, and facilitating maritime trade and exploration during the medieval period."
 dip_tech_cs_13_desc:0 "The Hanseatic League was a powerful trading alliance of merchant guilds during the medieval period. The league facilitated and regulated trade across northern Europe, including the Baltic Sea region. Hanseatic merchants established trading posts, known as Hanseatic cities, and engaged in lucrative commerce, particularly in commodities such as salt, fish, furs, and timber. Hanseatic trade networks fostered economic growth, cultural exchange, and political influence in the regions where they operated."
 dip_tech_cs_14_desc:0 "Following periods of economic decline and disruption, the recovery of trade during the medieval era was a crucial catalyst for economic growth and societal development. The reopening of trade routes, the revival of urban centers, and the emergence of merchant guilds stimulated commercial activities. Increased trade led to the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures, fueling innovation, prosperity, and interconnectivity among regions."
 dip_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "Economic specialization became more pronounced during the medieval period as different regions focused on specific industries or trades. Certain areas became known for their expertise in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, or craftsmanship. This specialization allowed for the efficient allocation of resources, the development of trade networks, and the growth of economic interdependence between regions."
 dip_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "The barque, a sailing ship with three or more masts, was a common vessel used during the medieval period. It was highly versatile and capable of long-distance voyages, making it suitable for trade, exploration, and warfare. Barques were characterized by their distinctive rigging, which allowed for efficient sail handling and maneuverability. The use of barques played a significant role in maritime activities and contributed to the expansion of trade and exploration."
 dip_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "The rise of city states was a significant political and economic development during the medieval period. Cities gained increased autonomy and became centers of trade, commerce, and cultural exchange. The growth of city states led to the emergence of new social classes, the development of urban infrastructure, and the establishment of unique legal and governance systems. City states played a crucial role in shaping the socio-political landscape of the medieval world."
 dip_tech_cs_18_desc:0 "Diplomacy became an increasingly valuable tool during the medieval period, as rulers sought to negotiate alliances, resolve conflicts, and secure their interests. Skilled diplomats played a key role in mediating disputes, conducting negotiations, and maintaining diplomatic relations between states. Diplomatic efforts aimed to prevent wars, foster peaceful resolutions, and promote stability among nations."
 dip_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "The medieval period witnessed a shift in intellectual and artistic pursuits, marked by the emergence of the Renaissance. The winds of the Renaissance brought about a renewed interest in classical knowledge, humanism, and scientific inquiry. This cultural movement, characterized by advancements in art, literature, philosophy, and science, laid the foundation for the transformative changes that would shape Europe and the world in the centuries to come."
 dip_tech_cs_20_desc:0 "The first true ocean-going ship. Unlike galleys and cogs, Carracks can serve the role of proper ocean-going warships."
 dip_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "Creation of legal and regional infrastructure in order to promote trade will not only encourage commerce but also allow us to better tax it."
 dip_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "Overseas trade is very risky but also highly profitable. The development of financial instruments like letters of credit will help reduce the risk, increasing our profits."
 dip_tech_cs_23_desc:1 "Land transportation of a lot of cargo is simply too expensive, moving it by ship is more efficient. Building shipyards will provide enough ships to do so."
 dip_tech_cs_24_desc:0 "With an extra boost to naval morale, our sailors will conquer the waves and rule the seas. While our colonists will be able to brave the dark corners of the world, founding new settlements farther from home than ever before."
 dip_tech_cs_25_desc:1 "As time progressed an expanding and increasingly advanced shipbuilding sector put new demands on seaports. Well maintained and planned docks went from being a convenience to a necessity for any location wishing to become a centre for naval or maritime activity."
 dip_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "Development of the lateen sail allowed Carracks to sail much closer to the wind than earlier vessels. Enhanced maneuverability made them superior to other ships.    "
 dip_tech_cs_27_desc:0 "A Flute is a specialised cargo vessel capable of carrying a large load with a very small crew. Flutes were designed to be built cheaply and in large numbers. A useful ship if you need to move things across the oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "The great wharfs and jetties will act as entrepôts for the world's goods. Let us build them and prosperity will follow."
 dip_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "Throughout the 16th century the increasing sailing ability of ships together with a growing number of more efficient guns have led to an increasing specialization of ship types. A Man of War is a ship dedicated entirely to sea warfare with a greater number of guns and ammunition than a ship that would also have to act as a Merchantman could ever hold. In the long run this development will lead to growing permanent navies and the development of naval tactics to better fit the new realities of sea warfare."
 dip_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "The world is a big place and in order to develop our trade in it sometimes quite big risks must be taken. Luckily there are Merchants in our country that would be willing to do so, using mostly their own capital. By sanctioning such companies with a Government charter giving them special rights to exercise government powers as well as monopolies in certain areas we can control and encourage commercial development of everything from foreign trade contacts to our colonial possessions overseas."
 dip_tech_cs_31_desc:0 "Galleys were light and small, and it was very difficult to mount cannons on them. The Galleass was a larger vessel capable of carrying a broadside of cannons like a man-of-war. To compensate for this extra weight, Galleass would be equipped with an additional sail."
 dip_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "Galleon was created by lowering the forecastle and elongating the hull. These changes in design improved the speed and stability of the ship. Which was of vital importance for Galleons to serve as better gun platforms."
 dip_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "With more and more countries sending their subjects or citizens abroad on various trading ventures and with so many living so close to each other for so long times it has become absolutely essential to have at least a basic concept of common laws of the seas. With publications such as 'Mare Liberum' or the later 'De Dominio Maris Dissertatio' the foundations to an international law of the seas has been laid."
 dip_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "Further development of transport ships led to construction of larger and faster vessels, which still tried to maintain the simplicity of construction of the Flute. These ships fell under the generic term Merchantman."
 dip_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "In order to make better use of the various developments in naval warfare new tactics are required. The evolution of broadside cannon have meant that the most efficient way for ships is no longer to seek to board the other party but rather to form a line of battle to be able to maximize the amount of firepower directed at the enemy."
 dip_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "The War Galleon, also known as a race-built Galleon, was built by reducing the number of decks on a Galleon. This sacrificed cannons for maneuverability, which proved to be beneficial in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "Even at the beginning of the 17th century permanent navies were quite small and even naval powers of note would mostly maintain a naval force to meet their immediate needs. Over time, however, we are moving in the direction of a larger professional navy. Unless we want to see our rivals overtaking us in naval matters we must strive to create a larger permanent navy with an administrative structure to support it as well as ensure that a naval career can be a permanent occupation for our officers."
 dip_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "Originally developed by Barbary Corsairs, this galley didn't carry as many guns as a galleass, but it was smaller and far more maneuverable. This improved maneuver allowed it to be far more effective in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "In 1614 a rather mad physician wrote a treatise suggesting that scurvy was a result of a dietary problem and could be solved by consuming lemon or lime juice. As it turns out, there was method in his madness and we have started providing this new diet for our sailors. Other countries call us limey now."
 dip_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "The original frigate design described any ship that was built for speed and maneuverability. As the concept developed though, it became its own unique class of a ship designed to support ships of the line."
 dip_tech_cs_41_desc:0 "A special version of the Frigate originally developed for operation in the Baltic. It kept a broadside of a frigate, but had a shallow draft and oars giving greater maneuverability in shallow waters, while sacrificing seakeeping in open oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "The addition of a third deck was a small sacrifice in maneuverability for a huge gain in close combat. The additional deck gave the ship an ability to fire onto the decks of smaller two-decker ships, while at the same time protecting its own deck."
 dip_tech_cs_43_desc:0 "The East Indiaman was the largest merchant ship built, it typically could displace in excess of 1,000 tons and measure over 175 feet in length. Those queens of the oceans were the most efficient way of moving men and cargo around the globe."
 dip_tech_cs_44_desc:0 "Life at sea is full of dangers and thus the punishments need to be harsh. If they do not have a sufficient deterrence effect, we will quickly run into trouble. Over time a system of highly public punishments has evolved, and now the time has come to formalize those. This will greatly enhance discipline at sea."
 dip_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "As trade grew, so did the risk. New ways of accumulating capital and managing risk needed to be developed. In Joint Stock Companies the risk of enterprise was shared among their many shareholders."
 dip_tech_cs_46_desc:0 "Originally the midshipman was a rank given to an experienced seaman who worked amidships. Men who aspired to become officers would often choose to serve in this role. If we formalize this, and make it a precondition for acquiring the rank of a commissioned officer, we will ensure our future leaders understand the ships they command."
 dip_tech_cs_47_desc:0 "A further reduction of risk came with the development of insurance. The ability for people to offset risk through payment of a small fee to an insurance broker allowed for further growth of trade."
