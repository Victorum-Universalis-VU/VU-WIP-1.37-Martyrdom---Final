#VU updated to 1.35 by San Felipe 
#Moving forming decisions to VU_Replace_Vanilla_Country_Formations

#I normally don't like messing with vanilla files when I don't have to, but between all the map changes and the fact that I wanted to clean up a few things
#and make everything more dynamic anyway, I figured I'd just reorganise. Hope this doesn't mess with anyone too much. - Darth Modus
