trade_goods = livestock			#Warby suggested livestock based on sausage production. An excellent idea. I also personally half-recall something about this area having a disproportionately large production of books, scrolls, and learning. Though I can't corroborate this atm, so for now, livestock. Maybe it was Lleida I'm thinking off... ah well.
