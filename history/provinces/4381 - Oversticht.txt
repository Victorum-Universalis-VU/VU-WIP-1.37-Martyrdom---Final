1477.1.5 = { owner = HAB controller = HAB add_core = HAB }	#from vanilla. Mary of Burgundy, an heiress, passes all Burgundian holdings in the Low Countries to the Habsburgs
#Charles V inherited the Seventeen provinces in 1506, would later go on to inherit Spain, then finally the HRE
1516.1.23 = { owner = SPA controller = SPA add_core = SPA } #Only later grouped with Spain, but for engine/gameplay reasons, calling it Spain upon the countries creation.
1519.1.12 = { remove_core = HAB hre = yes } # Charles V elected emperor and gains total control over his Burgundian inheritance.
#Darth Modus note - Base files say 'Flanders incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire' in 1548. I can neither easily find info on this, nor disprove it, unless it is refering to the 'Pragmatic Sanction of 1549'. While it is true that this act centralised the Low Countries and organised them within a HRE structure, it also appears to have explicitly outlined the Low Countries as 'not part of the HRE'.
1549.11.4 = { owner = NED controller = NED add_core = NED remove_core = SPA hre = no }	#From vanilla, appears to be the creation date for the Netherlands according to Paradox, though still as a vassal of SPA. Calling this date good enough, and also removing province from HRE at this point.
1566.1.1 = { unrest = 5 religion = reformed }	#Beeldenstorm causes religious tension between Reformist Spanish Netherlands and 'protector of the Counter-Reformation' Philip II.
1579.1.6 = { unrest = 0 }	#Union of Utrecht signed in the north in response to the Union of Arras, effectively legitimising and centralising Dutch authority in the region.
