#5808 - Skagit

culture = salish
religion = totemism 
capital = "Kwúbe"			#Cocrete would seem the best candidate, but little evidence of native settlement. Newhalem also seems feasible, but only etymology found is an asinine story about a goat. History seems poor here in general, as I'm also finding no good non-anglicised spelling for Skagit. Going with Mount Baker for lack of better options.
