#Undecided on above. To represent the very last remenants of the Cumbric language culture. The People were still classified as their own group at the turn of the century. King Alexander (d. 1286) had on his royal seal "King of Scots and Britons" linking to Brythonic Celtic speakers. Brythonic names were found in areas such as Peebleshire into the late 1200's, and arguably later. Wallace (from William Wallace) meaning "Welsh Men" which likely links to Cumbric. In 1305, Edward I abolished the "Laws of the Brets and Scots" suggesting by this point there was little need for the seperate Britton Law, with the area then taking on Scots Law.
