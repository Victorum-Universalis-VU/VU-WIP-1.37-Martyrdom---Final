#Histories
1720.2.17 = { owner = SPI controller = SPI add_core = SPI remove_core = SAV } # Treaty of the Hague, Victor Amadeus II trades Sicily for Sardinia, founding the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia
1792.9.1 = { controller = FRA } # Conquered by Napoleon without a siege at the beginning of the War of the First Coalition
1796.4.26 = { owner = FRA add_core = FRA add_local_autonomy = 65 } # The Republic of Alba proclaimed in the town of Alba. Calling it high autonomy because I don't want to mess with client states in history
1796.4.28 = { controller = SPI owner = SPI add_local_autonomy = -65 } # Victor Amadeus III given back control of Savoy with the Armistice of Cherasco
1798.9.10 = { controller = FRA owner = FRA add_local_autonomy = 65 } # Piedmontese Republic founded, though in reality it seems to have been mainly just an occupation. I'd just call it controller = FRA, but vanilla doesn't have SPI in the proper wars files so I'm doing full ownership to avoid bugs
1799.6.20 = { controller = SPI owner = SPI add_local_autonomy = -65 } # Austro-Hungarian and Russian troops reoccupy Piedmont, returning it to Sardinia-Piedmont
1800.6.20 = { owner = FRA add_core = FRA add_local_autonomy = 65 } # Napoleon retakes it, renaming the Piedmontese Republic to the Subalpine Republic, though in reality it seems to have been mainly just an occupation. I'd just call it controller = FRA, but vanilla doesn't have SPI in the proper wars files so I'm doing full ownership to avoid bugs
1814.4.11 = { owner = SPI controller = SPI remove_core = FRA add_local_autonomy = -65 } # Napoleon abdicates and Victor Emmanuel is able to return to Turin
